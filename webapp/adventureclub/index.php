    <p>Thrill of adventure and love of nature always push to explore remote and
        far-flung areas and to find new destinations. To face the hardships of
        such kind of experience and in order to quench the thirst of a vagabond
        instinct; there are several activities in the world, which can be
        included in the category of adventure. In Pakistan, mountain climbing,
        rock climbing, trekking/hiking, skiing, hot air ballooning, paragliding,
        canoeing sailing, rafting and mountain biking etc. are known only in a
        small circle of enthusiasts.</p>

    <p>About two decades earlier, we started to visit famous tourist areas,
        which later on turned into soft adventures, like day hikes and camping
        etc. Now, the Club announces several programs for the interest of people
        of all age groups and with diversified range of activities on annual
        basis. The multi dimensional activities of the Club include adventure
        and training programs based on education oriented objectives and
        considering the social & ecological conservation of the area
        visited.</p>

    <p>The Club, welcomes people from all walks of life to participate in our
        socio-adventure activities, without any barrier of age, gender, cast or
        creed.</p>
