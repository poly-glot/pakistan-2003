                                        approximately 21 kms from National Highway is a sandy track across rugged
                                        scrubland to be covered by jeep to the Fort.
                                        <br>Reach Ranikot Fort by 12.00 noon (carry lunch boxes). Ranikot is one of
                                        the largest forts in the World. The Fort's massive 10 meter high walls
                                        of dressed sandstone are 30 kms in circumference.
                                        <br>Seen from a distance, portions of its ramparts resemble the Great Wall
                                        of China, as they dip and turn to the contours of the hills. The Fort was
                                        built by Imran Bin Musa Barmaki, the Governor of Sindh in 836 A.D. The
                                        Fort's structure, encircling many hills, has a diameter of about 9 kms.
                                        The entire walls are made of Gypsum and lime cut stone. It was originally
                                        constructed for bow and arrow warfare but it was later enlarged to accommodate,
                                        fire arms.
                                        <br>1600 hours, leave for Sehwan Sharif (80 kms from Ranikot Fort). Reach
                                        Sehwan Sharif at 1900 hours and check in at Sindh Government Motel/Rest
                                        House. Overnight stay.</p>
