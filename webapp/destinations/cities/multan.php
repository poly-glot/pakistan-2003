        <p>A circular road around the rampart gives access to the city through
            thirteen gates. Some of the imposing structures of these gates are
            still preserved. In the bazaars of the Old City one can still come
            across tiny shops where craftsmen can be seen busily turning out
            master-pieces in copper, brass, silver and textiles in traditional
            fashion.
        </p>

        <p>The old city has narrow colorful bazaars full of local handicrafts
            and narrow winding lanes. There are many historic, cultural and
            recreational places of interest in Multan. It is a commercial and
            industrial center.

            and camel-skin work) and cottage industries. There are hospitals,
            public gardens, and several colleges affiliated with the University
            of Punjab. The University of Multan was established in 1975. Large,
            irregular suburbs have grown outside the old walled-town, apart from
            this, two satellite towns have also been set up. The numerous
            shrines within the old city offer impressive examples of workmanship
            and architecture. These shrines are the foremost attractions for
            tourists.

            engravings with glazed bricks. The shrine of Shah Rukn-e Alam
            (Tughlaq period) has one of the biggest domes in Asia while the
            shrine of Sheikh Yusuf Gardez is considered to be a masterpiece of
            the Multani style. Other shrines may include the Pahladpuri Temple
            and the Idgah Mosque (1735).
