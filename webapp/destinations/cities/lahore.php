        <p>Lahore is the second largest city of Pakistan and the provincial
            capital of Punjab. Apart from being the cultural and academic centre
            of the country, Lahore is the Mughal "show-window" of Pakistan.

            In the Mughal days a 9-meter high brick wall surrounded the Old City. It had a rampart running around
            it which almost connected with the River Ravi to serve as protection
            for the city. A circular road around the rampart gave access to the
            city through thirteen gates. Some of the imposing structures of
            these gates are still preserved. In the bazaars of the Old City one
            can still find tiny shops where craftsmen can be seen busy turning
            out master-pieces in copper, brass, silver and textiles in
            traditional fashion.

        <p>In modern days, Lahore hosts a large number of industrial units
            running day and night to play their vital role in developing the
            country's economy. Lahore is also an important center of
            journalistic activities. A large number of newspapers, journals and
            magazines are published here. Lahore is a great commercial and trade
            center. It has combined the life style of east and west and presents
            a lively mixture of some old and new patterns of life.

        <p>The most important historical monuments of the Moghul's in Lahore
            are; the Royal Fort (Shahi Qila), the Badshahi Mosque. The
            Independance monument, the tombs of emperor Jehangir,

            Noor Jehan, Anarkali, Asif-Jah and the famous Shalimar Gardens. In the old part of the town and off
            the Kashmir Bazaar, reputedly the most beautiful Mosque of South
            Asia is located, the "Wazir Khan's Mosque'. It is a marvellous
            specimen of tile work and arabesque paintings. The Imperial or the
            Badshahi Mosque is accross the courtyard from Alamgiri Gate of the
            Lahore Fort. The Mosque, made up entirely of red sandstone, was
            built by Emperor Aurangzeb. 5 kms east of old city, are the famous
            Shalimar Gardens laid out by Mughal Emperor Shah-Jehan in 1642 A.D.
            The Gardens are set out in typical Mughul style and are surrounded
            by high walls with watchtowers at the four corners. The Golden
            Mosque is also situated in the Kashmiri Bazaar. It was built in 1753
            A.D. by Nawab Syed Bhikari Khan who was Deputy Governor of Lahore.

        <p>The ashes of the Sikh ruler of Punjab, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh, and of
            his four wives lie in a dome adjacent to the Hazoori Bagh and is
            famously known as 'Samadhy of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh'.
