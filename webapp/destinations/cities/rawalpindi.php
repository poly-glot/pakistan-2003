        <p>Rawalpindi (1,700 feet) is divided into an old city
            and and a new city or contonment (called cantt.) that are separated
            by rail road tracks. The new city was developed when the British began settling in 'Pindi
            during the last century and built a completely new town with
            colonial buildings and wider streets next to the existing city with
            its bazaars and galis. Originally Rawalpindi was a village of
            Rawals, a tribe of Yogis. In Rawalpindi Cantt. several inexpensive
            hotels are offering good packages for economy travelers. There are
            many bazaars in the Rawalpindi region the Raja Bazaar, Saddar Bazaar
            and Commercial Bazaar (Market) are some nice shopping areas. The
            Liaquat Bagh 'Liaquat Gardens' is a nice picinc spot for tourists.
            The Bara Market near the Liaquat Bagh is an all time favourite
            amongst tourists coming to Rawalpindi. It has a lively atmosphere
            and with many beautiful architectures and colors of life it is a
            wonderful tourist hideout.
