            Physically, Quetta comprises of a series of long valleys 4500 5500-ft above sea level enclosed by the
            Central Brahui range in the south and drained by the Pishin Lora
            River and its tributaries. Quetta can righlty be called the fruit
            basket of Pakistan. Its climate is dry and well-suited for the
            cultivation of grapes, peaches, plums, apricots, apples, almonds,
            pears, and pomegranates. Wheat, barley and corn are Quetta's most
            common crops. Saffron grows very well on mountains around 5000 feet
            high. It is being cultivated on a commercial scale. While Felts,
            Rugs, Silk Embroidery and Copper Vessels are Quetta's major
            handicrafts.

        <p>The Quetta division was constituted in 1955. It is a mountainous
            region bounded by The Solomon Range on the East and The TobaKakar
            Range at the North, thus separating it from Afghanistan.

            At the South-End of Chaman (near Afghan border) are the Khawaja Amran and Sarl Ath ranges. Across the
            former lies the famous Khojak Pass with the Shelabagh railway tunnel
            piercing 2.5 miles (4 km) of solid rock. From Nushki (Southwest of
            Quetta city) to Dalbandin (Southwest of Nushki), the division
            consists of a levelled sandy plain. Amongst its chief rivers are
            Dalbandin and Pishin Lora. Rainfall is scarce in these parts of
            Pakistan therefore cultivation mostly depends upon irrigation from
            Karezes (underground channels) in the sub-mountainous region and
            springs and streams in the highlands. Wheat is the main Rabi
            (Spring) crop while Jowar (sorghum) is the chief Kharif (autumn)
            crop in the plains and Corn in the highlands. Apart from these crops
            Cooking coal is mined at the Khost Area in Sibi and in the Sor
            Range, east of Quetta.
