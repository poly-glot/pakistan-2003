        <br>

        <p> The city was founded by Sultan Muzaffar Khan of Bamba dynasty and
            was the seat of an independent State for quite a long period. The
            city is now a combination of old and new buildings and a blend of
            different cultures and languages.

            It has besides official buildings; farms, parks and historic forts standing on the banks of
            the Neelum, Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Rawalakot and Kotli and are
            connected with the rest of Pakistan through Micro-wave telephony
            system.

        <p>Well-Pass the Red Fort, crossing Neelum river at Ghori, a few km away
            is the 'Makra mountain' 3,890 meters which is visible from
            Muzaffarabad and continues on to Shogran in the Kaghan Valley. This
            is a superb short trek, although you may need to camp overnight at
            halfway. The upper Jhelum valley makes another interestingly scenic
            excursion from Muzaffarabad. By following the Jhelum upstream and
            taking the road beneath the Domel Bridge you'll be retracing the old
            route to Srinagar.

            The valley is broad with raised terraces above the river. Rice and maize are widely grown. Some 10
            kms out of Muzaffarabad the river widens to from a small lake. A
            landslide is resposible for all this. Located here, is a small
            Angler's Hut, which makes it a pleasant picnic spot. It is also
            possible to take boats out on the river. You can make your Bookings
            through the Tourist Department in Muzaffarabad.

        </p>
        <p>There are ample rest houses, hotels and guesthouses in Muzaffarabad
            City where tourists can stay in comfort and enjoy their
            sarroundings. The Muzaffarabad bazaar can be explored for its walnut
            carvings and Kashmiri shawls. It is sometimes possible to get a good
            bargain!!
