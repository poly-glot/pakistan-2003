            Dabo, it surrendered to the British, the capital was then
            transferred to Karachi.

            Newly developed settlements and industrial estates surround the congested old city area. An
            noteworthy characteristic of this city is, badgirs (wind-catchers)
            fixed to housetops to catch sea breezes during the hot summer
            season. A hospital, municipal gardens, zoo, sports stadium, and
            several literary societies are in the city. The University of Sind
            with 32 affiliated colleges was founded in 1947 in Karachi and moved
            to Hyderabad in 1951, where it lies across the Indus. Other
            education needs are served by numerous government colleges, the
            Liaquat Medical College and specialized vocational institutions.
