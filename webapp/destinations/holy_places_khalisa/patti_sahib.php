    <p>It is also called Gurdwara Maulvi Patti, lies midway between Gurdwara
        Janam Asthan and Gurdwara Bal Lila. It is along the road leading from
        Janam Asthan to the railway station. Patti means a wooden table on which
        young scholars practise writing. Hence the name of the shrine which
        represents the village school attended by Guru Nanak Dev. It is also
        said that young Nanak surprised his teacher by composing and reciting an
        acrostic, called Patti, and that is why the shrine is called Patti Sahib
        or Maulvi Patti. The Gurdwara consists only of the sanctum in a small
        square domed room. </p>
