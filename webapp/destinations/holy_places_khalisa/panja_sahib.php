    <br>

    <p>Hasan Abdal is a small town and a railway station along the main
        Lahore-Peshawar railway line in (Attock) district. Close to it is a
        spring of cool, clean water which according to tradition was created by
        Guru Nanak Dev. It is said that the Guru arrived here at the end of his
        tour of West Asia</p>

    <p>According to Sikh historian, the Guru sent Mardana thrice to the Wali to
        drink and fetch some water, but every time the latter refused to oblige
        saying that the would not help a Muslim (Mardana
        was a Muslim) who followed a 'Hindu' Guru. Guru Nanak then asked Mardana
        to remove a stone nearby from there water sprang forth. At the same time
        Wali Kandhari's water reservoir went completely dry. Wali Kandhari,
        infuriated by the 'Hindu's' miracle, rolled down a rock towards the
        latter. Guru Nanak Dev, sitting unruffled, merely extended his right arm
        towards the rolling rock. Not only the rock stopped dead, his open palm
        made an imprint on it as if it was made of molten wax. Wali Kandhari,
        impressed by the miracle came down and bowed before the Guru seeking his
        pardon and blessing. </p>
