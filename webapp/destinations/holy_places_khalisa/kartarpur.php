    <br>

    <p>Kartarpur was founded by Guru Nanak Dev at the
        request of some of his followers and settled here permanently with his
        family and some of his disciples who wanted to live near him and serve
        him. Here, after formally installing Bhai Lahina (renamed by him Angad)
        as his spiritual successor, he cast off his mortal frame and mingled
        with the Eternal Light of which he had been the brightest spark. </p>

    <p>It is said that his Hindu and Muslim disciples wrangled about the manner
    of funeral rites. Hindus constructed a dehura or samadh and the Muslims
    a grave. Both were after some time washed away by the waters of Ravi.</p>
