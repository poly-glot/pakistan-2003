    <p>This shrine representing the home of Baba Kalua and Mata Tripta, father
        and mother respectively of Guru Nanak Deve, (where the Guru was born)
        was established by Baba Dharam Chand (1523-1618 son of Baba Lakhmi Das
        and Grandson of Guru Nanak Dev. Its present building comprising a
        square, domed sanctum with a rectangular pavilion attached to it within
        a vast walled compound was built by Maharaja Rangit Sing (1770-1839).

        Sing (June) and birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev (November), Pakistan
        government allows Sikh Jathas (groups), to visit this and other shrines
        at Nankana Shaib, Sacha Sauda and Lahore. Pakistan government provides

    <p>Gurdwara Bal Lila is another magnificent shrine, about 1.5 furlong east-south-east
    of Gurdwara Janam Asthan, on the side of a sarovar which is said to have
    been built initially by Rai Bular. It represents the village playground
    where young Nanak assembled his playmates not only to engage in physical
    sports but also to act as a holy man sitting in meditation.</p>

    by Maharaja Rangit Singh, who also enlarged and properly lined the sarovar
    Nanaksar. Its present three-storey domed building was raised during the
    1930's and 1940's and was completed shortly before 1947.</p>
