    <p>Sikh history originates from Nankana Sahib as Gura
        Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikh faith, was born here in 1469. The name of
        the place at that time was 'Rai Bhoi di Talvandi'. The landlord
        contemporary of Guru Nanak Dev was Rai Bular, who himself became a
        devotee of the Guru. It was renamed Nankana after the Guru. It is
        located about 75 kilometers west-south-west of Lahore. Nankana Sahib is
        in Sheikhupura district and is connected to the district town by rail
        and road. There are several shrines connected with the memory of Guru
        Nanak Dev's childhood and early youth here. Some of the are Gurdwara
        Janam Asthan, Gurdwara Bal Lila, Gurdwara Patti Sahib and Sacha
        Sauda. </p>
