    <p>Nanga Parbat (main peak) has a height of 8,126m/26,660 ft. It has three
    vast faces. The Rakhiot (Ra Kot) face is dominated by the north and south
    silver crags and silver plateau; the Diamir face is rocky in the beginning.
    It converts itself into ice fields around Nanga Parbat peak.<img src="/img/destinations/mountain_peaks/nanga_parbat/nangaparbat_02t.jpg"
    class="thumb" align="left">The Rupal face is the highest precipice in the
    world. Reinhold Messner, a living legend in mountaineering from Italy,
    says that "every one who has ever stood at the foot of this face (4,500m/14,764ft)
    up above the 'Tap Alpe', studied it or flown over it, could not help the
    amazement of its sheer size; it has become known as the highest rock and
    ice wall in the world!". Nanga Parbat has always been associated with tragedies
    and tribulations until it was climbed in 1953. A lot of mountaineers have
    perished on Nanga Parbat since 1895. Even today it is claiming a heavy
    toll of human lives, mountaineers in search of adventure and thrill, and
    in finding new and absolutely un-climbed routes are becoming its victims.</p>

    class="thumb" align="left">It was in 1841 that a huge rock-slide from the
    Nanga Parbat dammed the Indus river. This created a huge lake, 55 km long,
    like the present Tarbela lake down-stream. The flood water that was released
    when the dam broke caused a rise of 80 ft in the river's 3 level at Attock
    and swept away an entire Sikh army. It was also in the middle of the nineteenth
    century that similar catastrophes were later caused by the damming of Hunza
    and Shyok rivers.</p>
<p>The Nanga Parbat peak was discovered in the nineteenth century by Europeans.
    The Schlagintweit brothers, who hailed from Munich (Germany) came in 1854
    to Himalayas and drew a panoramic view which is the first known picture
    of Nanga Parbat. In 1857 one of them was murdered in Kashgar. The curse
    of Nanga Parbat had begun!</p>
