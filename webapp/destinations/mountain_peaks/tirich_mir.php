    class="thumb" align="left">Tirich Mir like Rakaposhi and Nanga Parbat to
    the east, is known for being the home of 'Peris' called "fairies" in english.
    The Tirich valley parallels the Turikho Valley and is separated from it
    by a 15 mile-long flat-topped ridge which averages about 12,500 feet in
    elevation. The ideal way to reach this ridge, for its unsurpassed views
    of the high peaks in the Hindu Kush, is to climb Zani An (12,500). Zani
    An is situated between Shagram and a mile higher than Drasan, thus it is
    most easily approached from the Tirich valley, because the climb is 2,000
    feet less from this side.The ridgetop in both directions from the pass
    is quite level, inviting you to stroll along it and view the spectacular
    Hindu Kush peaks from Tirich Mir to Saraghrar and north.</p>
<p>Tirich Main peak (7,708m/25,288ft) was climbed for the first time in 1950
    by a Norwegian expedition which was lead by Arne Naess. The other members
    of the expedition included P. Kvern berg and H. Berg. The expedition was
    also accompanied by Professor Hameed Beg of the Karakoram Club (Pakistan)
    who reached an altitude of over 6,096m/20,000ft quite a feat in those times.
    Captain Tony Streather of Chitral Scouts tagged alongwith the expedition
    from Drosh and eventually climbed Tirich Mir.</p>
<p>The first major attempt by Pakistanis was the Karakoram Club's expedition
    to Tirich Mir in 1951. The expedition was led by Mian Abdul Rauf and consisted
    of Daud Beg, Arshad Munir and Captain Shaukat Malik. It set up three advance
    camps and reached 6,553m/21,500ft before abandoning the attempt due to
    shortage of supplies.</p><img src="/img/destinations/mountain_peaks/tirich_mir/tirichmir_02t.jpg"

<p>Tirich Mir (West I): Its height is 7,487m/24,563ft. The peak was climbed
    in 1967 by a Czechoslovak expedition led by Vladimir Sed ivy. It is, however,
    doubtful whether this was the first ever climb on the peak by this party.
    The party is stated to have climbed it by the north-west col. J. Cervinka,
    I. Galfy, V. Smida and I. Urbanovic reached the top. In addition to the
    above climb, the party made quite a few climbs on other mountains. Some
    of them were the first-ever climbs.</p>
<p>The fifth highest peak in the Tirich Mir range is Tirich Mir (West Ill)
    which is 7,400m/24,278ft high. It was climbed in 1974 by Groupe Universitaire
    de Montagne et de Ski of France and was led by Guy Lucazeau and Bernard
    Amy. The sixth peak of the Tirich Mir range is Tirich Mir (West IV) - 7,338m/24,075ft.
    It was climbed in 1967 by Kurt Diemberger and Dietmar Proske through the
    very difficult north face. Diemberger also made the first circle around
    the Tirich Mirs. The purpose was to carry-out geological survey of the
    area. His route passed through Shagram (above Zani pass) Atak Banduk -
    Shaikh Naik - Tirich glacier - Ano glacier - Lower Gazikistan glacier -
    Arkari valley - Owir pass - Barum -Lethzom - Atak and back to Shagram.</p>
<p>Another interesting peak in the Tirich Mir range is un-named with a height
    of 7,100m/23,294ft. This peak is situated to the south of Tirich Mir (Main)
    peak. It is therefore better to call it Tirich Mir (South). Yet another
    interesting peak of the range is northern spur of Tirich Mir which is stated
    to be 7,056m/23,149ft high. It was climbed in 1965 by Kurt Diemberger,
    Herwig Handler and Fritz Lindner of a German - Austrian expedition.</p>
<p>Tirich Mir (Little) (6,550m/21 ,489ft) can be considered as the last peak
    in the Tirich Mir range. The peak was attempted by Pak-Karakoram Club expedition
    in 1951 but was eventually climbed in 1969 by the British-Pak Army Mountaineering
    expedition which was led by Maj. J. W. Fleming of the British Army. Captain
    Mumtaz Khan and Lieutenant Azhar Hussain represented the Pakistan Army.
    The party approached the peak from Chitral via Shogor, Beshgram, Susum,
    Lasht and Owir pass, Awi and South Barum glacier. Captain M.W.H. Day, Captain
    R.A. Summerton and Corporal J. Anderson were able to climb the peak. The
    party indicates its height as 6,361m/20,869ft. Tirich Mir still holds its
    attraction and lure for enthusiastic climbers....</p>
