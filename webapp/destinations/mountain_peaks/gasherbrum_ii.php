    <br>

    <p>The climb on this peak is both on rock and ice. A high level of technical
    skill, physical fitness and acclimatization is required. The approach to
    basecamp is via Skardu and takes about a week's trekking on Baltoro Glacier.
    An expedition to Gasherbrum II provides a more complete mountaineering
    experience than the commonly guided Tibetan 8000m peaks (Shishapangma &amp;
    Cho Oyu) which can be reached by jeep roads.The walk to Gasherbrum II base
    camp along the Baltoro glacier has been described as one of the best treks
    in the world.</p>
