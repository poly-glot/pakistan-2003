    class="thumb" align="left">In 1958 a strong Italian expedition led by Riccardo
    Cassin climbed Gasherbrum IV peak through north ridge after over-coming
    great climbing difficulties. It were mountaineers like Walter Bonatti and
    Carlo Mauri who successfully ached its top. They spent the whole night
    at camp-6 because of a severe snow storm. At day-time they came down to
    camp-5 (7,193m/23,600ft) through a very dangerous route. It was one of
    the members of this party, Giuseppi de Francesch, who stopped himself from
    falling to his death from this mountain.</p>
