    class="thumb" align="left">The glacial water from Ultar carries brightly
    reflecting mica and other minerals, locally called "water flowers", which
    give the liquid a glittering life of its own even as it quietly slips by
    in an irrigation canal miles away from the steep 'Ultar Nala'. Near Kareemabad
    and Baltit you can see Bubelimating ("Bubela's Peak"), a granite pinnacle
    and next to it is the rounded Ultar Peak which frustrated all climbers.
    The narrow gorge of Ultar conceals pastures and a glacier that cannot be
    seen from the valley floor. The walk up Ultar's steep nala can be an unforgettable
    experience. Nonetheless, Ultar seems to be a peculiar crucible for the
    foreigners who approach it.</p>
