    <br>

    <p>Zhob valley starts from Muslim Bagh, which is the center of Chromate Mines
    and is located 96 kilometers north east of Quetta. Coming to Muslim Bagh
    and not visiting the chromate mines is a waste of tour. The Muslim Bagh
    is known as an Oasis of Orchards. Yet another place to see in Muslim Bagh
    is Asia's highest Railway Station Kanmehtarzai Pass, which is on the road,
    that connects Fort Sandeman with Bostan.</p>

    Rana Ghundi is an archeological site having mounds from which remains of a culture have been found with affinities spread to the Hisar
    culture of North East Iran dating back to 3500 BC. Red Pottery has also
    been found, which is estimated to belong to a period earlier than the Indus
    valley civilization. Fort Sandeman (10000 feet) above sea level is at the
    Afghan Pakistan border and is sorrounded with beautiful scenery. Sheenghar
    (Green Hill) at this height is covered with Pine forest and is the best
    area in the valley to shoot Chakor.</p>

    <p>Qila Saifullah is the seat of the famous Jogezai family located on the
    ancient Carvan routs. It is famous for its Apples, Pistachio Nuts, and
    some beautiful scenery spots. Its community is known to be the earliest
    agricultural community in the Indo Pak Subcontinent, which flourished at
    the beginning of 3000 BC. The climate here is heavy, but enthrillingly
    seductive for adventure travelers!</p>
