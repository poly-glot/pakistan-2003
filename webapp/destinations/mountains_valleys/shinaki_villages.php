    <b><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black" size="5">HUNZA &GT; SHINAKI VILLAGES</font></b>
    <br>

    <p>Nasirabad is the largest village in the area, with about 400 houses and
    a population ten times that number. It has undoubtedly grown since the
    Karakoram Highway (KKH) which passes through Nasirabad was opened in the
    1970's. The other vilalges of the project area are smaller with about 100
    dwellings, dotted amongst the tapestries of fruit trees, small fields and
    meticulously constructed terraces.</p>

    <p>The area is stunningly beautiful. The environment varies from sub-zero
        temperature on the summit of Rakaposhi, to the intense heat of summer in
        the valleys. The people, forests, plants and wild animals have all adapted
        to find a niche within this most inhospitable of environments.</p>

    <p>As you travel up the KKH from Gilgit to Hunza Valley, you will notice
        the harshness of the environment, with little or no vegetation on the lower
        mountain slopes. The whole of this area is essentially a mountain desert,
        with less than 10 inches of annual rainfall. Any trees that you see here
        owe their existence to the human hand - and the painstaking construction
        of irrigation channels.</p>

    <p>Summer is warm and pleasant here, with average temperatures around 30
        degrees Celsius. It becomes extremely cold in winter with temperatures
        below freezing. With snows not only confined to the peaks and ridges but
        decorating the trees of the valley bottom, the area takes on a new and
        stunning beauty, making it worth braving the cold. Winter visitors also
        stand a much better chance of seeing the prized wildlife of the area, such
        as the Himalayan ibex, as they venture much lower down the slopes in search
        of grasses to eat.</p>

    <p>The most dominant geological feature of the area is Rakaposhi (7,788m),
        first climbed in 1958 and ranked among the world's 50 highest peaks. The
        people of Shinaki claim that they have the best view of this peak. Stunning
        views of both Rakaposhi and its sister peak, Diran, can be seen from some
        of the trekking routes described below. The area abounds with natural springs
        of excellent quality. Nasirabad village has one such spring which has been
        certified as having excellent mineral water.</p>

    <p>Minerals like zumurrad, ruby, and white marble are found in and around
        the villages of Hussainabad an dNasirabad. According to local people, the
        white marble mine in Nasirabad village is known to be the second best in
        the world after Italy.</p>

    <p><b>Mayoon Bar</b></p>

    <p>Mayoon Bar is the name given to one of the summer pastures above the village
        of Mayoon. A six-hour trek up Mayoon Nullah from the village will lead
        you here. The trek passes through steep undulating areas along the valley
        side. Look out on the way for the birds of this area, including the Chukkar,
        Jungle Crow, Yellow-billed Chough, and the Magpie. Keep alert, and when
        you stop, look all around - you may be rewarded with a view of the Himalayan
        ibex, Cape hare or the Tibetan red fox.</p>

    <p>In summer, pastures come alive grasses and a whole variety of plants,
        transforming the area into a green carpet dotted with colour. Shepherds
        live in their huts during summer, keeping a watchful eye on their stock.
        Easy access to good quality water from the nullah (stream), makes Mayoon
        Bar a wonderful camping location.</p>

    <p><b>Rooi Bar</b></p>

    <p>Rooi Bar is an area similar to Mayoon Bar, also located within Mayoon
        Nulalh, but on the eastern side of the nullah. The trek to Rooi Bar is
        more adventurous than the previous one, altitudes and is therefore closed
        during winter since it is blocked by snow. Cock can also be seen along
        this route. Sightings of some of the more elusive wild mammals are possible
        in the higher areas.</p>

    <p>Suitable small camping areas can be found, and shepherds' huts also provide
        potential resting places.</p>

    <p><b>Bayyais</b></p>

    <p>Bayyais is used by the people of Hussainabad village as a summer pasture,
        and for growing agricultural crops. Local people take three to four hours
        to reach Bayyais, if travelling on foot from Hussainabad. The route is
        easy and the pasture is lush green, in stark contrast to the formidable
        rock scenery all around.</p>

    <p><b>Hachinder</b></p>

    <p>The trek to Hachinder starts from Nasirabad, and takes around three or
        four days in one direction. In the case of all these treks, the only accommodation
        facilities are informal camping grounds and occasional shepherd's huts.
        Trekkers should be fully equipped with fine tents and sleeping bags, and
        other accessories so that they can fully enjoy these unfrequented destinations.
        All who care for the environment should also take adequate supplies of
        kerosene, thus helping to protect the area's precious fuelwood supplies.</p>

    <p><b>Nasirabad Stadium [Rakaposhi Viewpoint]</b></p>

    <p>Nasirabad Stadium is the name given to a spectacular amphitheatre in the
        higher part of Nasirabad village. It offers a stunning view, especially
        of Rakapohsi and Diran Peaks.</p>

    <p>The view downwards form this point, towards the Hunza River and the tall
        thin poplars way below reminds one of the scale of the Karakoram Mountains.</p>

    <p><b>Local Handicrafts</b></p>

    <p>Shinkaki has a cultural centre called Dar-ul-Huner where local women have
        been trained to produce local handicrafts. This is an important area of
        development, supporting local people. You can be sure that the purchase
        of these 100% natural and meticulously handmade items directly benefits
        these communities. Locally available handicrafts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Woolen handbags and small purses</li>
        <li>Sharma (local carpet)</li>
        <li>Traditional mats, rugs and bedspreads</li>
        <li>Caps and hats</li>
        <li>Pattu (local made cloth prepared form sheep wool, used to make jackets,
            etc)</li>
        <li>Local twine ropes</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Local Accommodation</b></p>

    <p>The only hotels in the area are located in Nasirabad village, and are
        small and very basic, though food is always available. The nearest town,
        Aliabad, is about 30 km to the south along the KKH, and has a better choice
        of traditional local hotels.</p>

    <p><b>Cultural Events</b></p>

    <p>Navroze on 21st March is both a religious and cultural festival. It is
        celebrated with dances and rallies as it marks the arrival of spring. Navroze
        is also the beginning of the Ismaili New Year. People gather at the village
        Jamaatkhana (community prayer area) to pray and the celebrations take place
        outdoors.</p>

    <p>Ganoni on 25th June marks the beginning of the harvest season. People
        paint their walls with flour paste and gather at the Jamaatkhana to pray
        and start their harvest. Sword dances and singing are also performed as
        part of this celebration.</p>

    <p>From 13 - 21st December, it is traditional for marriage ceremonies since
        this is the time when the harvesting is over and livestock are fat and
        healthy. People have a lot of free time during this period, having been
        freed from their agricultural work.</p>

    <p>Bee-fowl is celebrated on the 15th of February and Nose is celebrated
        on the 21st of December for making Nasalo.</p>

    <p><b>Flora and Fauna</b></p>

    <p>Shinaki is host to a wide diversity of flora and fauna indigenous to the
        Northern Areas. Important wildlife mammals of the area are the Himalayan
        ibex, Tibetan red fox, Cape hare, snow leopard and wolf. The first three
        species can easily be observed in the area, but snow leopards and wolves
        are rarely seen, being both elusive and naturally inhabiting the higher
        mountain areas. Sightings of snow leopards depend almost totally on luck,
        although they are most commonly seen at dawn or dusk, and during winter.
        Some of the more notable birds of the area include the Chukkar (or Rock
        Partridge), Ram Chukar (or Himalayan Snowcock), Golden Eagle, Lammergier
        Vulture, Golden Oriole and the Alpine or yellow-billed Chough. These are,
        of course, accompanied by the ubiquitous Magpies and House Sparrows. Look
        out for them throughout the Shinaki Valley and especially when travelling
        towards the pastures. A pair of binoculars is undoubtedly a good asset
        in this expansive area.</p>

    <p><b>Main Tourist Season</b></p>

    <p>The main tourist season in the Northern Areas, especially in the Shinaki
        Area, starts around May and continues through to September. The summer
        temperatures ripen the many fruits of the valleys and the whole area becomes
        a lush green, especially the nullahs and pastures. The peak influx of tourists
        occurs in July and August, reducing to a trickle by September.</p>
