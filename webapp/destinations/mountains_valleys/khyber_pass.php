    <br>

    <p>The Khyber Pass, the route from Peshawar to Kabul in Afghanistan, is the
    feature of the NWFP province most widely known (and infused with romance)
    to the outside world. To visit This famous pass you need a special permit
    from the Political Agent because of the tribal dangers and official sensitivity
    over drugs and guns.</p>

    class="thumb" align="left">For trail enthusiasts, The Khyber Train journey
    from Peshawar to Landi Kotal is a three-star attraction. The British, built
    it in the 1920s at an enormous cost of more than two million pounds. It
    passes through 34 tunnels totaling five kms (three miles) and over 92 bridges
    and culverts. The two or three coach'es are pulled and pushed by two SG
    060 oil-fired engines. At one point, the track climbs to 130 meters in
    little more than a kilometer (425 feet in 0.7 miles) by means of the heart-stopping
    Changai Spur. This is a W-shaped section of track with two cliff-hanging
    reversing stations, at which the train wheezes desperately before shuddering
    to a stop and backing away from the brink. The Khyber train currently runs
    only by appointment. Groups of 20 to 45 passengers can book one bogey for
    an all day outing to Landi Kotal and back, a ride lasting ten to eleven
    hours. You can easily steal a glimpse of this train resting at Peshawar
    Station. This journey allows you to explore parts of Pakistan like you
    have never done before.</p>
