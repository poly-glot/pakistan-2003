    <br>

    <p>The Bar Valley, a collective name for the Dainter and Garamsai River Valleys,
    originates west of the Batura mountain (7,785 m) in the Karakoram Mountain
    Range, and slopes down to the Barkot Village, a few kilometers upstream
    the Bola Das River.</p>

    <p>Bar is one of the many narrow, steep mountain valleys in the heart of
        the Karakorams. On its South-East side, the majestic Rakaposhi towers at
        7789 m and in the North, the Batura overlooks the valley from 7785m. Over
        a dozen other equally impressive peaks around the Bar area are over 7600
        m. high.</p>

    <p>To reach the Bar Valley one has to fly or drive in to Gilgit from Islamabad.
        From Gilgit traveling North up the Karakoram Highway (KKH) for 49kms, you
        turn off onto a jeepable road from Chalt driving another 22kms to arrive
        at Barkot, the main village in the valley.</p>

    <p>Get a glimpse of ancient customs, as well as cultural and historical events,
        through traditional dances and songs. Watch a thrilling game of traditional
        Polo, played with extraordinary stamina and skill, given the high altitude
        of the playground.</p>

    <p>Scenic spots are reserved for camping, and tents are accessible on rent.
        Clean, basic accommodation is also made available by the villagers in their
        traditional homes.</p>

    <p>Varying high and medium altitude treks lead to adjoining valleys and glaciers.
        One is treated to spectacular views of the valley at every point.</p>

        Wildlife use Project based on utilization and management of the Siberian
        Ibex (Capra ibex sibirica) population, in collaboration with the local
