    <br>

    <p>The Khunjerab is on a continental watershed. All water on the Pakistani
    side flows down to the Indian Ocean, while that on the Chinese side is
    swallowed by the Taklamakan Desert, the name of which means, that, if you
    go in, you don't come out'. It is 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the top
    of the pass to the abandoned Chinese border post at Pirali.</p>

    The scenery is remarkably different on both sides of the pass. The Pakistani side depicts a vertical world of desert-gorges
    devoid of any sign of human life for about 30 kilometers (19 miles), except
    for the road itself. The Chinese side is a wide- open, grassy high-altitude
    plateau with grazing herds of yaks, sheep and goats tended by Tajik herders.
    Children and dogs, romp among round felt tents called Yurts. The Tajiks
    are a smiling and friendly lot, and the women are as happy to be photographed
    as the men. Camels, on this side of the border appear to be altogether
    different. This journey promises adventure and thrills for all enthusiasts.</p>
