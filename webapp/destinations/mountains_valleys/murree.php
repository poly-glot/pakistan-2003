    <br>

    <p>Since independence, Murree has once again become the summer retreat of
    the governor of Punjab and since Islamabad became the capital of Pakistan
    in 1962, it has expanded rapidly. Some 10 km from Murree is 'Bhurban' which
    is another favourite.

    The resort at 'Patriata', some 15 km southeast of Murree, is situated on a ridge 2,223 meters above sea level and offers
    a breathtaking view of the valley. One of the most exciting features of
    Patriata is the 3 km dual chair lift and cable car system from Gulera Gali
    to the Patriata ridge. Murree remains charming all year round. In summer
    it is cool - even chilly in the evening - while light rain is common. In
    winter, Murree hides herself under thick thick blanket of snow. Which proves
    to be an extremely attractive vacation spot for travelers. It is extremely
    popular amongst Punjabis escaping the heat of the plains in summer and
    gets too crowded for comfort during late May to early September, especially
    at weekends. To beat the crowds and still enjoy the walks, the best time
    to go to Murree is during April-May and September-October.</p>

    <p>Murree spreads along the top of a ridge for about five kilometres (three miles).
        <img src="/img/destinations/mountains_valleys/murree/murree_03t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">
        At the northeast end, is the famous Kashmir point, which views across the valley of the Jehlum River into Azad Kashmir.
        At the southwest end resides the Pindi Point, looking back towards Rawalpindi
        and Islamabad. Between the two, runs The Mall, at the center of which,
        lies the main Shopping area where most people congregate. Numerous roads
        leave The Mall and either follow the contours of the ridge or descend to
        the principal road. Promenading and shopping are Murree's main amusements,
        riding the new chair-lifts; one from Bansara Gali (below Murree) to Pindi
        Point, the other to the top of Patriata hill (on the road to Karor)are
        hot tourist attractions. Both rides cost about Rs. 50 and take half an
        hour with a change from open chair-lift to the enclosed bubble in the middle.</p>

    <p>Good buys in Murree are Kashmiri shawls, furs, walking sticks, fruits
        and nuts. Murree's pistachio nuts are reputed to be the best in Pakistan.
        An American journalist Camile wrote, that, "Everything and Anything can
        happen in Murree. Romance is in the atmosphere intrigue is in the air.
        The roads to this happy holiday's resort embrace both the heaven and earth.
        In Murree it is easy to fall in love".</p>
