    <br>

    <p>Winters are long and bitterly cold as temperature may go down to minus
    20 degrees Celsius at night, especially during December, January and February.
    The winter scene is not time often viewed by tourists, due to difficult
    access. During this time the valley becomes stunningly tranquil enshrouded
    in snow. Whereas summers are hot, reaching a maximum of around 36 degrees
    Celsius.</p>

    <p>This area is remarkably green and more vegetated than other parts of the
        Northern Areas. While Nanga Parbat shields Gilgit and Ghizer Districts
        form the monsoon rains, the last moisture laden winds still reach the area
        around Astor, which has an annual rainfall of between two and three hundred
        millimetres. The appearance of this moist Temperate Zone is much more like
        the forests of Europe, setting it apart from many forest areas of Pakistan.</p>

    <p>Bulashbar and Astor lie at the junction of several mountain routes, providing
        ample and varied trekking opportunities, including many short walks through
        this beautiful area. Tracks head eastwards from the Bulashbar area, up
        towards the wild but beautiful Deosai Mountains and Plains. To the norhtwest,
        a trekking route leads to the Muthat Pass and continues on to Fairy Meadow.
        In the southwest, Rupal Valley provides numerous opportunities for short
        and long treks. For these routes, arrangements should be made for a Shina
        - speaking guide from Chilas or Gilgit before arrival. Food and provisions
        are available in Astor. However, supplies are limited and it is advisable
        to bring all necessary supplies from Gilgit.</p>

    <p>Tourist season begins in June and lasts until mid October. The spring
        and summer months are lush green. Rainfall at this time of year makes a
        pleasant environment. Mid-summer is very hot, visitors at this time of
        year should be prepared to walk very early in theday, before the mid-day
        heat. The determined winter visitor, though may be rewarded with some unique
        sights.</p>

    <p><b>Cultural Events</b></p>
    <p>The Bulashbar area is predominantly Sunni Muslim. Two events take place
        in May-Dirma and Ditch. Both events are held to celebrate greenery which
        can be seen sprouting all around. It is also a celebration of the agricultural
        season getting into full swing.</p>

    <p>Chiligon, in the month of June, is a harvest festival and is celebrated
        when the wheat crop is mature and ready to be gathered.</p>

    <p><b>Places of Interest</b></p>
    <p>In the area surrounding Gorikote and Bulashbar, there are many places
        of natural beauty. Locals are a great source of information on all aspects
        of the surrounding areas, at least to those with a smattering of Shina
        or Urdu, or with a guide/interpreter. Below is a small selection of some
        areas worth a visit.</p>

    <p>Bulashbar Valley is an area of outstanding natural beauty, with sparsely
        forested hillsides, clear waters, and plenty of places to relax and feel
        the grandeur all around. Wildlife sightings of certain species are common
        here. Domusur Nullah lies about 7 km east of the village of Gorikote, and
        is four hours relatively easy trekking from there. The area is covered
        with coniferous forests, birch trees and junipers, and is interspersed
        with lush pastures in the spring and summer months.</p>

    <p>Kinibri is located in the west of Gorikote, and is well worth a visit
        for its natural lakes and beautiful green pastures. From Gorikote the walk
        heads westwards for about 6 km until one reaches Kinibri. It takes 3 -
        4 hours, each way, on this route.</p>

    <p><b>Games</b></p>
    <p>The people of this area love sports, despite the difficulties posed by
        the mountainous terrain and the nature of field games requiring an open
        area. With the arrival of spring, and warmer weather, some of the locals
        engage in fast paced games of polo in nearby Astor. The children amuse
        themselves with guli danda, which has the advantage that it can be played
        everywhere.</p>

    <p>The guli is a small, cigar-shaped piece of wood, slightly thicker in the
        middle and with both ends tapered to a point. The danda is a sturdy stick
        nearly 3 feet long, used as a bat or club. The guli is thrown onto the
        ground and hit with the danda. Locals also love to have an impromptu game
        of cricket, volleyball or football in summer, improving on the necessary
        equipment with just about whatever seems to do the job.</p>

    <p><b>Flora and Fauna</b></p>
    <p>Heavy rainfall in the area allows for a more diverse flora than in many
        other parts of the Northern Areas, giving a soft, picturesque look to the
        whole region. The mountain slope below the snowline provide favourable
        conditions for trees to thrive. Main species of this region are the kail,
        species of fir and spruce, several species of juniper, birch and the important
        chilghoza pine. The kernels of chilghoza are an edible delicacy across
        the whole of Pakistan, and fetch a good price.</p>

    <p>The summer pastures are home to a rich variety of flowering plants, many
        with medicinal properties. The conservation of many endemic and important
        medicinal plants found throughout the pastures of the Northern Areas is
        a key objective of WWF-Pakistan. We are working with the local communities
        on pasture management initiatives, forging new links with many companies
        for launching sustainable, income-generating schemes for the small-scale
        production and harvesting of these species.</p>

    <p>The change of climate in this area brings species of fauna, not found
        in the districts of Ghizer and Gilgit. Among them is the humorous and lovable
        golden marmot - commonly seen around the pastures of Bulashbar. Less frequently
        observed is the elusive, forest-dwelling leopard.</p>

    <p>If you carry binoculars, and have a keen eye, the ibex and the brown bear
        can both be spotted - usually at distances of 1-2 km. Nearby Deosai Plains
        is home to a good population of brown bears; thanks to the continued efforts
        of the Himalayan Wildlife Project in this area. The Tibetan red fox can
        usually be seen at dawn and dusk. However, the critically endangered, beautiful
        musk deer is unlikely to be seen, having been reduced to minute numbers
        by relentless hunting for its musk gland, which provides scent for the
        perfume industry. The most likely area for spotting it is around Saghri
        nullah, at dawn and dusk. The snow leopard and wolves are also present
        in the region, though extreme patience and determination (or sheer luck)
        are required to spot either of these species. The best time to spot wild
        mammals is between December and May.</p>
