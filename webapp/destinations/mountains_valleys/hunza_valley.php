    Lord Curzon, a former viceroy, said, "The little state of Hunza contains more summits of over 20,000 feet than there are
    of over 10,000 feet in the entire Alps." Visitors to Hunza are deeply overwhelmed
    by the rugged charm and the fragrant breeze singing through graceful trees
    and the lushious green attractively carpeted fields all set against a background
    of snow-covered mountains. Situated at an elevation of 2,438 metres, Hunza
    Valley's tourist season peaks from May to October. The temperature in May
    is 27 C maximum and 14 C minimum. While the October temperatures range
    from: 10 C maximum to 0 C minimum.</p>
    <p>Glaciers abound in this valley, including the 30-mile long Batura and the immense Virjerab
        <img src="/img/destinations/mountains_valleys/hunza_valley/hunza_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">and Hispar glaciers. The Nubra, Braldu, Hushe
        and Saltoro rivers are born in the glacier-laced Karakorum; the Shyok River
        encircles the eastern flanks of the range; but only the Hunza River actually
        cuts from north to south completely through the Karakorum Range. The Hunza
        River has its origin in name at the juncture of the Kilik and Khunjerab
        nalas, some 100 miles from the river's mouth near Gilgit. Carving a gorge
        between 25,000-foot peaks and receiving the waters of scores of glaciers,
        this is by far the largest and the grandest tributory of the Gilgit River
        watershed.</p>

    <p>Most parts of Hunza offer an awe-inspiring view of Rakaposhi (7,788 metres).
        The snows of Rakaposhi glitter in the moonlight, producing an atmosphere
        of ethereal magnetism. The fairy-tale like castle of Baltit, just above
        Karimabad, is a Hunza landmark built about 600 years ago. Stilted on massive
        legs, its wooden bay windows look out over the valley. Originally, this
        was used as the residence of the Mirs (the title of the former rules) of
        Hunza.</p>

    <p>The Hunza Valley is composed of "Hunza Proper" (as Hunzakuts call it) in the midvalley,
        <img src="/img/destinations/mountains_valleys/hunza_valley/hunza_03t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">while the larger upper valley region is called
        Gujal and is populated by the Wakhi-speaking ethnic Wakhi. Nagar, another
        former state, is located in two areas, and you will visit its narrow glaciated
        canyons as you proceed up the valley. The Nagarwals speak Burushaski with
        their own accent. Practice your Burushaski, with those you meet; people
        will enjoy it, and you may be asked in for tea. Burushaski is a complex
        language with four genders, and it is a "language isolate," unrelated to
        any other tongue. The famous Hunza water (famous for long life and youth)
        is locally called "mel". Four clans live in Hunza, and each is said to
        have originally come from a different region: Dramatin from Tartary, Barataling
        from Russia, Kurukutz from Persia, and Broung from kashmir.</p>

    <p>The 6-mile long fertile oasis beginning at Hassanabad contains small villages
        among terraced fields and is the center of the former state. Not far beyond
        Aliabad a link road branches uphill to the north of the KKH (Karakorum
        Highway)and is the direct way to Karimabad and Baltit (65 miles from Gilgit
        and ranging 500 feet up and down the hill at roughly 7,800 feet in elevation).
        Because of their inns and their spectacular location overlooking Rakaposhi
        and the green fields of Hunza and nagar, these two towns, Kareemabad in
        particular, function as the focus of Hunza for most visitors.</p>

    <p><img src="/img/destinations/mountains_valleys/hunza_valley/hunza_04t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">
        Just beyond 'Ganesh Village' below Kareemabad, the KKH (Karakorum Highway) crosses the Hunza river on a large, graceful
        bridge. Within walking distance from the bridge right on the roadside is
        'Haldikish' (Place of the Rams), also known as the "Sacred Rock" of Hunza.
        This large rock has many carvings from different eras and in varying scripts.
        At Shiskot the KKH crosses the west side of the river and soon reaches
        Gulmit (about 8,000 feet). Gulmit has a couple of lodges and the town in
        itself, is an attractive one to visit. Just above the lodges is the Hunza
        Cultural Museum.</p>

    <p>Hunza is an ideal place for mountaineering, trekking and hiking. Every
        area in the Hunza Valley up to, but not including , Chapursan is officially
        considered an openzone, even the dicey Hispar Glacier. Most treks in this
        valley are'nt particularly long ones but there are exceptions; the Hispar-Biafo
        walk and the hike to Shimshal are among such exceptions. Hunza genuinely
        offers an experience of a lifetime!</p>
