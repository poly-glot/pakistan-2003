    <b><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black" size="5">KIRTHAR NATIONAL PARK</font></b>
    <br>

    <p>Kirthar National Park is the habitat of rare species that include the
    Sind Ibex, Chin Kara, Gazelles, Leopards, Wildsheep, and other animals.
    The best season to visit is from October to February. However, it is the
    greenest in August during the monsoons. Five furnished rest houses with
    cooking facilities and running water are situated on the edge of a wide
    valley in the center of the park at Karchat. They are bookable through
    the Sind Wildlife Management Board, which also hires out tents to those
    who wish to camp. Some food is available if ordered well in advance, but
    it is better to take your own food, drink and bedding.</p>

    align="left">The rolling valleys and rugged lines of the Kirthar hills
    form a natural haven for urial sheep, ibex and chinkara gazelle. Jungle
    cats, desert cats and even the occasional leopard or desert wolf also prowl
    the park, but you would be extremely lucky to see them. Pangolin (scaly
    anteaters), porcupines and monitor lizards are in vast numbers.</p>
<p>Other attractions in the park are the 18th century Chaukundi style tombs
    at Taung and pre-historic archaeological remains at Koh Tarash. The enormous
    Rani Kot Fort is also within the park, two hours by jeep from Karchat.
    Rani Kot is about four hours from Karachi via the Super and the Indus Highways.</p>
