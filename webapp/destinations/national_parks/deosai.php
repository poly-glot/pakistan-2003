    <br>

    <p>Extending to about 40 to 50 miles and sorrounded by snow capped peaks,
    the Deosai has the purest of air. Clouds above may appear just beyond ones
    reach and hills that seem to be nearby retreat as you approach. The Deosai
    pose an inspiring captivation with their ever changing color with changing
    light. On the high plateau one may find very special plants and flowers.
    The plain is dotted with Edelweiss, in the Alps it is a protected flower.
    Between this almost exotic flora live bears, marmots and even the snow
    leopard may be found.</p>

    align="left">To the south of and visible from both the Burji and Stapara
    approaching areas is a 700-foot hill, on top of which is a 500 foot-high-rock
    cairn. This unnamed hilltop in the northern deosai region produces a clear
    panorama of the Himalayan Pangri Range and sections of the Karakorum. As
    you ascend its gentle, grass covered slopes, Nanga Parbat will come into
    view far to the west of you. In 'Gypsy Davy's' words, "It was such an expanse
    of immensity as I have hardly imagined...It seems you cannot talk in a
    matterof-fact way in a place like that...I thought the Sierras were large,
    but here, where we could see three or four score miles north, south, east
    and west, and see only mountains, and most of them above twenty thousand
    feet, the Sierras seem like sand dunes".</p>
<p>Wildlife:</p>
<p><img src="/img/destinations/national_parks/deosai/deosai_03t.jpg" class="thumb"
    align="left">The Deosai National park contains the largest Brown bear population
    in Pakistan. The park currently has about 20-25 Brown bears. This park
    was establised to protect these endangered bears. Recently a research project
    has started to monitor the population of these bears and protect their
    environment. Snow leopards also wander into the meadows of this unforgiving
    land. Mammals in the park may include--Brown bear, Snow leopard, Golden
    Marmot, Pika, Migratory hamster and Ermine. While birds may include--The
    Golden eagle, Lammagier vulture, Griffon vulture, Laggar falcon, Peregrine
    falcon, Kestrel, Indian sparrow hawk and Snow cock. Its splenderous beauty
    adds to this parks attraction. I must see for all tourists!</p>
