    <br>

    <p>Votive stupas were built around the main stupa by wealthy pilgrims hoping
        to gain merit. There were 215 of these, all decorated with statues,
        painted, guilded and topped with stone umbrellas. The best-preserved
        ones are on the north side of the main stupa with some of the decoration
        is still visible. The Jambil and Saidu rivers run on either side of the
        Butkara and have often flooded the site.
