    <p>The village is built on the ruins of the ancient town the foundation
        walls, which are still to be seen in tolerably good formation. As a
        proof that it was in the past occupied by the Buddhists and Hindu races,
        coins of those periods are still found at the site. From the description
        of Song Yun, a Chinese pilgrim, it appears that it was on one of the
        four great cities lying along the important commercial route to India.
        It was a well-fortified town with four gates outside the northern one,
        on the mound known as Chajaka Dehri which was a magnificent temple
        containing beautiful stone images covered in gold leaves. Not far from
        the rocky defile of Khaperdra did Ashoka build the eastern gate of the
        town outside of which existed a stupa and a sangharama.

    <p>The larger mound of But-Sagru on the main road to Swabi and close to the
        Ziarat of Akhun Baba confirms its Buddhist origin. The principal
        interest of the town to archeologist is the fact that it was the seat of
        the most celebrated of the jatakas and of fourteen rock edicts of Ashoka
        in Kharshti script, a form of Aramaic character introduced into this
        region by Darius the Great son of Hystaspes, about 500 B.C. All in all,
        it is an interesting journey consisting of a mixture of cultures and
        religions.
