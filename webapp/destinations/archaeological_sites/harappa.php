    <p>Situated besides an earlier course of the Ravi River, Harappa was
        discovered in 1920-21. The area of Harappa is bigger than Moenjodaro but
        much to the remains above ground were ravaged by brick-hunters using the
        material as blast when the railway tracks between Lahore and Multan were
        laid. However, several cemeteries, which escaped the attention of
        vandals, have been excavated to reveal the richness and sophistication
        of its culture.

    <p><img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/harappa/harappa_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">Like Moenjodaro the excavations have
        revealed a series of cities, stacked one upon another. The site, with
        its citadel and great granary, seems similar in many ways to Moenjodaro
        and like its southern sister-city appear to have thrived around 2000 to
        1700 B.C. with an economy based largely on agriculture and trade. The
        Harappan society seems to have been egalitarian, pursuing a rather
        simple way of life. The cemeteries discovered at Harappa confirm that
        the Indus Valley people buried their dead, many of them wearing finger
        rings, necklaces of steatite beads, anklets of paste beads, earnings and
        shell bangles. Copper mirrors, antimony rods, shell spoons and vessels
        and urns of various shapes and size lay in the graves. Some of the
        female skeletons had anklets of tiny beads and girdles studded with
        semi-precious stones.

    <p>Excavations have recalled evidence of some pre-Harappan material, which
        shows strong affinity, with some Kot Diji finds. On display at the
        Museum is excavated material, including terracotta toys, gamesman, and
        jewelry, animal figurines, bronze utensils statuettes etc. Harappa and
        Moenjodaro are two places which form the focal point of tourist
        attraction. So if you are in Pakistan do'nt miss these historical
        journeys. You'll be facinated by the displays and exotic archeological
        finds!
