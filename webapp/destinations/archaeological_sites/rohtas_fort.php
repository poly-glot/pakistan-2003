    <br>

    <p>Built over ten years from 1540 by Sher Shah Suri, the fort is one of the
        most imposing historical monuments in Punjab. It is situated on the edge
        of the Kahan Gorge, which provided the only route from
        <img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/rohtas_fort/rohtas_fort_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left"> the mountainous country north of the
        Salt Range, to the southern plains. A 5km perimeter wall, with massive
        battlements, bastions and gates encircles the fort. The fort's
        perimeters were designed strategically to utilise the natural ravines,
        which, together with about a kilometre of the riverside, act as natural
        moats for the defensive system.
