    <p>Pushkalavati is first mentioned in the Hindu epic story, The Ramayana,
        when Bharata the brother of Ramchandra conquered Gandharvadesa
        (Gandhara) and found two cities, Taksha (Taxila), and Pushkala
        (Pushkalavati) named after his two sons.
    </p>

    <p>Hieun Tsang visited it and he refers to it as Po-Lu-Sha, according to
        him, it was 2.5 miles in circumference. A Brahminical temple to the east
        and a monastery to the north which according to Buddhist legends, was
        the place where Buddha preached law. After Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered the
        area in 1026 A.D the name Gandhara disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>The Bactrian Greeks, the next rulers of Gandhara, founded a new capital
        city of Pushkalavati at what is now Shaikhan Dheri, to the north east of
        Bala Hisar on the other side of river one can see on the top of the
        mound one part of Shaikhan Dehri.

    <p>At the crossroads in the center of Charsadda, turn right towards the
        "Prang" through the hundreds of acres of graves all decorated with black
        and white stones in geometric patterns. There are several mounds in
        Prang. Prang is probably a corruption of Prayag, which indicates that it
        was a sacred city. The people of the area may feel likewise which may be
        the reason why they bring their dead there for burial.
    </p>

    <p>There was a fort built by the Sikh called Sharkargarh 17 miles near
        Charsadda a small town called Shabqadr. Mohmand's burned this town in
        1897. It has since been rebuilt!
    </p>

    <p>Bibi Syeda Dheri is north of Uzmail village in Charsadda tehsil. Here is
        a mound 60-ft high, which is believed to be the site of the stupa,
        erected to commemorate the conversion by Lord Buddha of goddess Hariti
        who used to devour children of their locality. There exists a famous
        shrine, that of Bibi Syeda. It is believed that a pinch of soil from
        that site is effective against smallpox.
    </p>

    <p>There are also two archeological sites near Charsadda i.e. "
        Shar-i-Napursan" and "Palatu Dheri". These two sites also belong to the
        era of Buddhism. With all its mystical magic, Charsadda remains an
        attractively wonderful journey for tourists, one that is filled with
        historical mystique and spiritualism.
