    <p>Research shows that people here lived in houses and were involved in
        hunting, domesticating of animals and farming cereals like barley and
        wheat. This hunting-farming society developed gradually and their
        pursuits were creative. During the early period these people used stone
        and bone tools i.e. polished stone-axes, flint blades and bone-pointers.
        By 6000 B.C. the hand-made pottery appeared and in the 5th millenium
        B.C. Metallurgy and potter-wheel were introduced and they produced some
        fine terra-cotta figurine and pottery with exotic geometric designs.

    </p>
    <p>Subsequently they produced and wore ornaments of beads, seashells and
        semi-precious stones like Lapis Lazuli. A museum has been set up at sibi
        where a wide range of rare finds from the site of mehergarh are on
        display. This is a wonderful archeological display for interested
        tourists.
