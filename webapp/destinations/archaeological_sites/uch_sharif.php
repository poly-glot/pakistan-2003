             class="thumb" align="left">The famous shrines existing at Uch
        include those of Hazrat Bahawal Haleem, Hazrat Jalaluddin Surkh Bukhari,
        Makhdoom Jahanian Jahangasht, Shaikh Saifuddin Ghazrooni and Bibi
        Jawandi. The shrine of Bibi Jawandi is a central asian design, titled in
        the blue and white faience. The tombs are either Square or domed. The
        tomb of Bibi Jawindi is the most completing, octagonal in shape. The
        later tomb of Jalal Surkh Bukhari is unusual with a superb wooden roof
        painted in lacquer, predominantly red and blue. The tomb of Baha'al
        Halim has horizontal stripes of blue and white faience tiles, although
        little of it remains.

    <p>Uch Sharif is the most ancient and historically the most important place.
        Situated about 9 miles from Punjnad, its old town still commands a great
        reverence not only of the local people but also in other parts of South
        Asia as well as in Iraq and Iran because the town once used to be one of
        the most important centers of Islamic education. It was indeed a city of
        renowned saints. A city, spirited with strong historical mysticsm and
        cultural glory.
