    <p>The site consists of two parts: one comprising of the citadel area on the
        high ground where the ruling elite lived and an outer area inhabited by
        common man. The Kot Diji culture is marked by well-furnished, well-made
        pottery and houses built of mud-bricks on solid stone foundations.
        <img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/kot_diji/kotdiji_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left"> In fact, the Kot Dijian ceramics,
        though different in form and technique, are in no way less artistic than
        the sophisticated back-on-red pottery of Harappans.

    </p>
    <p>The Harappans borrowed some of the basic cultural elements from Kot
        Dijians. The Harappan decoration designs, such as the "fish scale "
        intersecting circles and the piped leaf pattern were all evolved from
        the Kot Dijian decorated elements like the horizontal and wavy lines,
        loops and simple triangular patterns. There is, however, no proof yet of
        the place or the region from where these Kot Dijians arrived in The
        Indus Valley. There is so much to see and explore that tourists and
        researchers find themselves lost in a never ending excursion of a rich
        archeological past.
