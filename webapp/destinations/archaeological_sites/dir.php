    <p>The topography of Dir is mainly hilly. The Punjkora River flows through
        and divides Dir in almost two equal parts. The climate is extremely cold
        in winters and moderately warm in summer. Dir for its rich heritage,
        poses to attract both archeologists and naturalists. A visit, worth
        remembering!
