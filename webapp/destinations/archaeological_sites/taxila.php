    <p><img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/taxila/taxila_01t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">At Taxila, you can see the great Buddha.
        His eyes will gaze upon you till you find yourself gripped by the
        feeling of awe. Other people whom you can meet at Taxila are, Alexander
        of Macedonia, Asoka the famous Buddhist king and Kanishka. You'll find
        their imprints all over the place.

    </p>
    <p>In 327 B.C. Alexander conquered Taxila which was the Achaemenian Empire.
        Later it came under Mauryan dynasty and reached a great level of
        development under the rule of great Asoka.

    </p>
    <p>The next step in Taxila's history was the indo-Greek descendents of the
        Alexander warriors. The final period is called The Gandhara period. The
        great Kushan Dynasty was then established in 50 A.D, and within these
        200 years Taxila became the most renowned center for philosophy, art and
        learning. <img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/taxila/taxila_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">Taxila is the greatest attraction for
        the pilgrims and tourists coming from China and Greece. The final period
        of Taxila is in the fifth century A.D. when white Huns snuffed out the
        most successful and the greatest Gandhara civilization of last several
        centuries.

    </p>
    <p>Exploring Taxila is a multi-dimensional experience. The richness and
        variety of the famed Gandhara sculpture is bound to attract your
        attention. There are many images of Buddha, in stone and stucco and
        numerous panels depicting all the important stages of the great Sage's
        life. One may also find sculptures of the world's most impressive men of
        peace. Each carved bit of sculpture shows extravagant beauty and
        mesmerizing artistery, from colossal to miniature there are literally
        thousands of such master peices in this collection. To find the
        difference between the Greek-Roman counterparts and the Gandhara
        masterpieces will be of great challenge to you. To welcome you there,
        are stone men and women who will receive you with open arms in Taxila.
        <img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/taxila/taxila_03t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">Then there are the three distinct
        cities, which are nicely preserved. With your imagination sided by the
        carved people who inhabit these cities, you will have little difficulty
        in picturing crowds on the well-laid-out streets, families in spacious
        houses, priests in the towering stupas and royalty in great palaces.

    </p>
    <p>The earliest city of these, is known as Bhir Mound. Which was established
        somewhere in the sixth century B.C, whose irregular streets, cramped
        houses and mediocre public buildings indicate its primitive origins.
        Then comes the Sirkap city which is on the opposite side of Tamara
        stream, and was built somewhere around the 2nd century B.C. You will
        find a marked difference between these cities as this city was well
        planned.

    </p>
    <p>As you stroll down its streets you can call at the houses of the affluent
        and go slumming, as it were, in the more crowded sections where dwelt
        the common man of the dim and misty past. Note the fortification of
        wall, the long, straight and impressive main street, the Royal palace,
        an Apsidal Temple and the shrine of the double headed eagle. Sirsukh the
        most modern city of them was built by Kushan kings in the first century
        A.D. It is'nt fully excavated as yet but is clearly, a well-fortified
        and well-laid-out city. This city is patterned after the Central Asian
        cities, and is complete with suburbs.

    </p>
    <p><img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/taxila/taxila_04t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">In addition to these cities, there are
        many monasteries and stupas which have been excavated all along the
        Taxila valley. Dharmarajika stupa, which is 2 miles from Taxila museum
        is a must see stupa. It comprises mainly of buildings, a monastery area
        where the monk lived and a series of small chapels. Wealth of gold,
        silver coins, gems, jewelry and other antiques were discovered at
        Dharmarajika.

    </p>
    <p>Jaulian, another marvelous complex of chapels, stupas, quadrangles, and a
        monastery with assembly hall, store rooms, refectory, kitchen and
        bathrooms. At five small stupas you will see some beautiful stucco, the
        relives of Buddha and Bodhisattvas and supported by rows of stone
        elephants and lions.

    </p>
    <p>Two miles west of Jaulian is another well-preserved monastery at Mohra
        Moradu. In one of the monk's cells here was found a stupa with almost
        all of the details intact. At Jandial, a mile-and-a-half from Sirsukh,
        is an imageless temple in the classic Greek style, with sandstone
        columns and cornices.

    </p>
    <p><img src="/img/destinations/archaeological_sites/taxila/taxila_05t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">Attraction for climbers is Glen of Giri,
        which is about three-and-half miles from Dharmarajika stupa. Atop the
        highest peak of the range of hills are two stupas and a fortress built
        in a cleft near a spring of pure, sweet water. The stucco decorations of
        the stupas are well worth the climb.

    </p>

        knew what they were doing when they chose Taxila to built there cities.
        To feel the enchanting aura and to understand their full importance
        you'll have to pay a visit to Taxila. It will take you to an inspiring
