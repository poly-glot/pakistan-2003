    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Pakistanis truly take pride in their 5,000 year old
        history which goes back even further into the hoary past yet untraced.
    </p>

    <p>In the words of Sir Mortimer Wheeler, famed British
        Archaeologist, Pakistan enjoys a high international position in the
        history of past achievements by virtue of possessing the greatest
        vestiges of one of the first three mature civilizations of the world.
    </p>

    <p>Pakistan is the known heir to one of the most ancient
        civilizations of the east - the Indus Valley Civilization, traces of
        which are found in the ruins of Moen-jo-Daro, Amri (on the right bank of
        the Indus in Sind), Kot Diji (on the left) and way up in the plains of
        the Punjab (near the city of Sahiwal), the remains of Harappa.
    </p>

    <p>The transition from rural past to urban life in the Indus
        valley was so sudden that the outside influence looks very probable. It
        appears that merchants of Mesopotamia who traded with settlements on the
        coast of the Persian Gulf made deeper voyages and penetrated into the
        Indus to find new trading partners, bringing with them their way of
        life.
    </p>

    <p>Indus seals - both from Moen-jo-Daro and Harappa - show a
        remarkable similarity with the finds at Tell Asmar, Ur and Kish in Sumer
        and at Susa in south-western Iran. So do the pots and utensils found in
        Mesopotamia and all along the Mekran coast and the cities on Indus.
    </p>

    <p>Later day evidence show signs of organised civil life and
        thriving cities borne by the ruins of Taxila in the Haro valley, some 30
        km west of Islamabad.
    </p>

    <p>The famed Gandhara civilization flourished in the lush
        green valley of Peshawar and the enchanting Swat. The developments on
        Pakistan's western frontiers made and un-made the history of South Asia.
    </p>

    <p>The old Indus served as the cradle of most civilization.
        The economy of the area still continues to be closely linked with this
        giant river as it was during the Bronze Age when Moen-jo_daro and other
        cities flourished on its banks, having trade and commerce with
        contemporary civilizations in Iran and Mesopotamia.
    </p>

    <p>Most traces of the Indus Valley civilization known abroad
        are the ruins of Moen-jo-Daro. To save them from the rising sub-soil
        water UNESCO is cooperating with Pakistan, which has resolved to save
        the remains from total destruction at all costs.
    </p>

    <p>The 'brink towers' of Moen-jo-Daro which impress and
        fascinate the visitors were, in fact, wells. They are evidence of the
        fact that the well-planned city with its Great Bath and Granary and
        'palatial' houses and civic centers was build orginally 40 feet below
        the surface of the present ground level. It would be worthwhile
        mentioning here some of the well-known finds from Moen-jo-daro which
        have over the years become familiar. They are the figure of the dancing
        girl, the head of the priest king and a large number of seals which bear
        animal figures, mostly bulls, with pictographs. Reproductions of these
        steatite seals decorate many a house in Pakistan and world capitals.
        Wooden doors found during excavations show high order of carpentry.
    </p>

    <p>These cities did not grow in a haphazard manner rather,
        they were build taking into consideration not only security but also the
        hygiene and public utilities. The planning and buildings were of high
        order and showed ingenuity.
    </p>

    <p>The unity of the long corridor of civilization is also
        testified by a uniform system of weights and measures, traditions in
        arts and crafts, social objectives and ideal, religious beliefs and
        rituals and a system of pictographic writing and perhaps one language.
    </p>

    <p>The river served as the main means of communication-north
        to south and south to north.
    </p>

    <p>In the rugged mountainous regions of western Pakistan the
        tribal traditions exist even today. Their love of freedom in reflected
        in their folklore. Nomads as these people were, they moved eastward to
        the plains of Ganges and got mingled with the caste-ridden culture of
        what they called Bharatvarsha.
    </p>

    <p>Recorded history of the region begins in the middle of
        the sixth century B.C. when the whole of the Indus region gradually
        became a part of Iran's Achaemenian empire under Cyrus, Darius and
        Xerxes.
    </p>

    <p>A notable feature of this period was the consolidation of
        separate identity of the Indus zone from that of Bharatvarsha. A stream
        of ideas and social patterns also followed via Iran from Mesopotamia and
        the Levant.
    </p>

    <p>The Persian rulers introduced their own weights and
        measures and the coin as a medium of exchange.
    </p>

    <p>Kharoshti scripts took the place of pictography and new
        values gave rise to such seats of learning as Taxila near which a fine
        example exists in the hill-top monastery of Jaulian. Stone cutting and
        engraving were introduced which led to the finest production of
        sculpture of that period - specimens of which are sometimes found even
        today buried in the fields, in and around the ruins.
    </p>

    <p>In-between the southern metropolis of Moen-jo-Daro and
        the northern capital of the Indus Valley - Harappa - are found traces of
        many flourishing cities dating back four to five thousand years. One of
        these is Amri, also on the right bank of Indus, some 160 km south of
        Moen-jo-Daro which French Archaeologist J.M. Casal put as 4,000 years
        old. He also traced cities dating back to 2,500 B.C. in the Kalat
        Division of Baluchistan - Nindowai and Ornach.
    </p>

    <p>But Kot Diji, 40 km east of Moen-jo-Daro on the left
        bank, is one of the earliest known fortified cities with a wall four to
        five meters high. It was a starting discovery in the late fifties which
        gave ew evidence of pre-Harappan culture and pushed back Pakistan's
        history by another 500 years.
    </p>

    <p>The story of the discovery of Harappa, which lay buried
        for many centuries, is interesting. In 1856 when the British were
        building the Lahore to Multan railway, they needed ballast and they
        found it in the form of finely baked bricks of Harappa - millions of
        them. It was only in 1872 that notice was taken of the mounds which
        stood 14 to 18 meters above the level of the fields. It goes to the
        credit of Sir John Marshall that the site was preserved in 1924-25.
    </p>

    <p>Excavation showed a city very similar in planning to
        Moen-jo-Daro and it seemed to have almost everything for comfortable
        living and a well-disciplined life. Objects found here are an unending
        variety of pottery, jewelry, ornaments, human and animal figurines,
        stone vessels, copper, bronze and silver utensils, metal objects, beads,
        household implements and, of course, seals. Like Kot Diji, it too has
        fortification wall with watch towers and bastions.
    </p>

    <p>Harappa's layout showed a lofty fortified citadel and low
        lying city with public and private buildings, workers colonies, work
        platforms and furnaces.
    </p>

    <p>The burial system was the same as found in Sumer in 3
        B.C. - bodies buried with ornaments and pottery in urn or otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Archaemenians' was a popular rule as people fought
        shoulder to shoulder with the invaders from the west, including
        Alexander.
    </p>

    <p>Alexander's invasion (327 B.C.) left lasting impressions
        in the Indus Valley and its traces are found right from the north in
        Bajaur to south at Sehwan in Sind where he built a fort. The Macedonian
        could not proceed further east beyond Beas. Though his rule was
        short-lived, the Indus valley absorbed many Hellenistic traditions.
    </p>

    <p>Taxila is not just one site. It is said, over hundreds of
        years several cities were built and destroyed in this small area among
        beautiful hills which once full of forests.
    </p>

    <p>Among the well-preserved sites the oldest is Bhir Mound
        near the famous Taxila Museum which houses some of the finest specimens
        of Ghandhara sculpture, gold ornaments and even scientific instruments
        dug out from the ruins.
    </p>

    <p>Other sites include the Dharmarajik Stupa, Sirkup - which
        was once a well-planned city on both sides of a broad road with straight
        streets crossing it at right angles. Near it are the ruins of the other
        city of Sirsukh and monasteries and temples and the very interesting
        remains of the Buddhist monastery stop a small hill which is in a
        well-preserved state, having small stupas showing the social structure
        of the time.
    </p>

    <p>The structure of the buildings is very different from
        that of Moen-jo-Daro. Instead of bricks, pebbles and bare rocks have
        been piles up to make walls and fortifications.

        North of Peshawar is the valley of Swat which is known for its beauty
        and remains of the Graeco-Roman origin. It was called Udayan in the
        ancient times (now Udegram) and the nearby town of Mingora, the capital
        of Swat, was called by Chinese traveller Hiueu Tsang as Meng-Chie-Li.
        Near here as many as 2,000 pieces of sculptured slabs and panels on the
        life of Buddha were discovered which included gilled statues. Some of
        the finds are housed in the Swat Museum.

        The most important King of Kushans, Kanishka, controlled the main trade
        routes from China and South Asia to the western world. His was one of
        the most prosperous empires in the early history of this area. It led to
        the flourishing of arts: the Ghandhara school of sculpture thus
        blossomed.
