    <p>Pakistan is divided into five distinct geographic
        regions: The Thar Desert and Lower Indus Valley in the south with arid
        valleys and rocky hills; The Baluchistan Plateau toward the west with
        elevation between 1,000 and 3,000 feet (300-900 meters) and covering
        nearly half the nation's territory; The Indus Basin, an irrigated
        agricultural area in the northeast; The Northwest Frontier, an area of
        barren mountains and irrigated valleys bordering Afghanistan; and The
        Far North with snowcapped mountains reaching high elevations.
    </p>

    <p>Seasonal temperatures vary widely in these five regions. With the exception of
        the Far North, summers are hot throughout the country with temperatures
        ranging to 90-120째F (32-49째C) and little nighttime relief. Trade winds
        provide some relief during the hot and humid summers in Karachi and a
        brief cool season comes between December and February. In Lahore,
        Islamabad, and Peshawar a distinct winter season brings daytime
        temperatures of 60째F (16째C) or less, cold nights, and - in Islamabad and
        Peshawar - frequent morning frost does occur during the stark winter
        season. Altitude governs climate in the Far North, with pleasant summers
        in the lower regions and perpetual snow in the higher mountains.
    </p>

    <p>The average annual rainfall varies from 6 inches (40 cm)
        in Karachi, 15 (38 cm) in Peshawar, 18 (46 cm) in Lahore, to about 30
        (76 cm) in Islamabad. Most rain falls during the summer monsoon from
        July to September, although parts of the Northwest Frontier and the
        Indus Basin experience a moderate winter rainy season as well.
