    <b><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black" size="5">BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN</font></b>
    <br>

    <p>The first permanent Muslim foothold in the South Asian Sub-continent was
        achieved with Muhammad Bin Qasim's conquest of Sind in 711 C.E. An
        autonomous Muslim state was established and Arabic was introduced as
        official language. At the time of Mahmud of Ghazna's invasion, Muslim
        rule still existed, though in a weakened form, in Multan and some other
        regions. The Ghaznavids (976-1148) and their successors, the Ghurids
        (1148-1206), were central Asian by origin and outlook and they ruled
        their territories, which covered mostly the regions of present Pakistan,
        from capitals outside India. It was in early 13th century that the
        foundations of Muslim rule in India were laid with extended boundaries
        and Dehli as the capital. From 1206 to 1526 C.E., five different
        dynasties held sway. Then followed the period of Mughal ascendancy
        (1526-1707), and their rule continued, though nominally, till 1857.
    </p>

    <p>From the time of Ghaznavids, Persian replaced Arabic as the official
        language. The economic, political and religious institutions developed
        by the Muslims bore their unique impression. The law of the state was
        based on Shariah and in principle the rulers were bound to enforce it.
    </p>

    <p>The question of Muslims identity assumed seriousness during the decline
        of Muslim power in South Asia. The first person to realize its acuteness
        was the encyclopedic scholar-theologian Shah Waliullah (1703-62). He
        laid the foundations of Islamic renaissance in the subcontinent and
        became a source of inspiration for almost all the subsequent social and
        religious reform movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. His immediate
        successors, inspired by his teachings, tried to establish a model
        Islamic state in the north-west of India and they, under the leadership
        of Sayyid Ahmad (1786-1831), waged an unsuccessful Jihad against the
        Sikhs.
    </p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the British had emerged as the dominant force in South Asia.
        Their rise to power was gradual extending over a period of nearly one
        hundred years. They replaced the Shariah by what they termed as the
        Anglo-Muhammadan law. English became the official language. These and
        other developments had great social, economic and political impact
        especially on the Muslims of South Asia.
    </p>

    <p>The failure of the 1857 War of Independence had disastrous consequences
        for the Muslims. Determined to stop such a recurrence in future, they
        followed deliberately a repressive policy against the Muslims.
        Properties and estates of those even remotely associated with the
        freedom fighters were confiscated and conscious efforts were made to
        close all avenues of honest living for the Muslims.
    </p>

    <p>The Muslims kept themselves aloof from western education as well as
        government service. But their compatriots, the Hindus, did not do so.
        They accepted the new rulers without reservation. They acquired western
        education, imbibed the new culture and captured positions hitherto
        filled in by the Muslims. If this situation had prolonged, it would have
        done the Muslims an irreparable loss. The man to realize the impending
        peril was Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (1817-1898), a witness to the tragic
        events of 1857. His assessment was that the Muslims' safety lay in the
        acquisition of western education and knowledge. He took several positive
        steps to achieve this objective. He founded a college at Aligarh to
        impart education on western lines. Of equal importance was the
        Anglo-Muhammadan Education Conference, which he sponsored in 1886, to
        provide an intellectual forum to the Muslims for the dissemination of
        views in support of western education and social reform. Similar were
        the objectives of the Muhammadan Literary Society, founded by Nawab
        Abdul Latif (1828-93), but its activities were confined to Bengal.
    </p>

    <p>Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was averse to the idea of Muslims participation in
        any organized political activity which, he feared, might revive British
        hostility towards the Muslims. He also disliked Hindu-Muslim
        collaboration in any joint venture. His disillusionment in this regard
        primarily stemmed from the Urdu-Hindi controversy of the late 1860s when
        the Hindu enthusiasts vehemently championed the cause of Hindi in place
        of Urdu. He, therefore, opposed the Indian National Congress, when it
        was founded in 1885, and advised his community to abstain from its
        activities. His contemporary and a great scholar of Islam, Syed Ameer
        Ali (1849-1928), shared his views about the Congress, but he was not
        opposed to Muslims organizing themselves politically. In fact, he
        organized the first significant and purely communal political body, the
        Central National Muhammadan Association. Although its membership was
        limited, it had above fifty branches in different parts of the
        subcontinent and it accomplished some solid work for the educational and
        political uplift of the Muslims. But its activities waned towards the
        end of the 19th century.
    </p>

    <p>At the dawn of the 20th century, a number of factors convinced the
        Muslims of the need to have an effective political organization. One of
        the factors was the replacement of Urdu by Hindi in the United
        Provinces. The creation of a Muslim province by partitioning the
        Province of Bengal and the violent resistance put up the Hindus against
        this decision was another. But the most important factor was the
        proposed constitutional reforms. The Muslims apprehended that under such
        a system they would not get due representation. Therefore, in October
        1906, a deputation comprising 35 Muslim leaders met the Viceroy at Simla
        and demanded separate electorates. Three months later, the All-India
        Muslim League was founded at Dhaka mainly with the object of looking
        after the political rights and interests of the Muslims. The British
        conceded separate electorates in the Government of India Act of 1909
        which confirmed League's position as an All-India Party.
    </p>

    <p>The visible trend of the two major communities going in opposite
        directions caused deep concern to leaders of all-India stature. They
        struggled to bring the Congress and the Muslim League on one platform.
        Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah (1876-1948) was the leading figure
        among them. After the annulment of the partition of Bengal and the
        European powers' aggressive designs against the Ottoman empire and North
        Africa, the Muslims were receptive to the idea of collaboration with the
        Hindus. The Congress-Muslim League rapprochement was achieved at the
        Lucknow session of the two parties in 1916 and a joint scheme of reforms
        was adopted. In the Lucknow Pact, the Congress accepted the principle of
        separate electorates and the Muslims in return for 'weightage' to the
        Muslims of the Muslim minority provinces agreed to surrender their slim
        majorities in the Punjab and Bengal. The post-Lucknow Pact period
        witnessed Hindu-Muslim amity and the two parties came to hold their
        annual sessions in the same city and passed resolutions of similar
        content.
    </p>

    <p>The Hindu-Muslim unity reached its climax during the Khilafat and the
        Non-cooperation Movements. The Muslims of South Asia, under the
        leadership of Ali Brothers, Maulana Muhammad Ali and Maulana Shaukat
        Ali, launched the historic Khilafat Movement after the First World War
        to protect the Ottoman empire from dismemberment. Mohandas Karamchand
        Ghandhi (1869-1948) linked the issue of swaraj (or self-government) with
        the Khilafat issue to associate the Hindus with the Movement. The
        ensuing Movement was the first country-wide popular movement. Although
        the movement failed in its objectives, it had far-reaching impact on the
        Muslims of South Asia. After a long time they forged a united action on
        a purely Islamic issue which created momentarily solidarity among them.
        It also produced a class of Muslim leaders experienced in organizing and
        mobilizing the public. This experience was of immense value to the
        Muslims during the Pakistan Movement.
    </p>

    <p>The collapse of the Khilafat Movement was followed by the period of
        bitter Hindu-Muslim antagonism. The Hindus organized two highly
        anti-Muslim movements, the Shudhi and the Sangathan. The former movement
        was designed to convert Muslims to Hinduism and the latter was meant to
        create solidarity among the Hindus in the event of communal conflict. In
        retaliation, the Muslims sponsored the Tabligh and Tanzim organizations.
    </p>

    <p>In the 1920s the frequency of communal riots was unprecedented. In the
        light of this situation, the Muslims revised their constitutional
        demands. They now wanted preservation of their numerical majorities in
        the Punjab and Bengal; separation of Sind from Bombay; constitution of
        Baluchistan as a separate province and introduction of constitutional
        reforms in the North-West Frontier Province. It was partly to press
        these demands that one section of the All-India Muslim League cooperated
        with the Statutory Commission sent by the British Government, under the
        chairmanship of Sir John Simon in 1927. The other section of the League
        boycotted the Simon Commission for its all-white character and
        cooperated with the Nehru Committee to draft a constitution for India.
        The Nehru Report had an extremely anti-Muslim bias and the Congress
        leadership's refusal to amend it disillusioned even the moderate
        Muslims.
    </p>

    <p>Several leaders and thinkers having insight into the Hindu-Muslim
        question proposed separation of Muslim India. However, the most lucid
        exposition of the inner feelings of the Muslim community was given by
        Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938) in his presidential address to the
        All-India Muslim League at Allahabad in 1930. He proposed a separate
        Muslim state at least in the Muslim majority regions of the north-west.
        Later on, in his correspondence with Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah,
        he included the Muslim majority areas in the north-east also in his
        proposed Muslim state. Three years after his Allahabad address, a group
        of Muslim students at Cambridge, headed by Chaudhry Rahmat Ali, issued a
        pamphlet Now or Never in which, drawing letters from the names of the
        Muslim majority regions they gave the nomenclature of Pakistan to the
        proposed state.
    </p>

    <p>Meanwhile, three Round Table Conferences was convened in London during
        the period 1930-32, to resolve the Indian constitutional problem. The
        Hindu and Muslim leaders could not draw up an agreed formula and the
        British Government had to announce a 'Communal Award' which was
        incorporated in the Government of India Act of 1935. Before the
        elections under this Act, the All-India Muslin League, which had
        remained dormant for some time, was reorganized by Muhammad Ali Junnah,
        who had returned to India in 1935 after a self imposed exile of nearly
        five years in England. The Muslim League could not win a majority of
        Muslims seats since it had not yet been effectively reorganized.
        However, it had the satisfaction that the performance of the Indian
        National Congress in the Muslim constituencies was bad. After the
        elections, the attitude of the Congress leadership was arrogant and
        domineering. The classic example was its refusal to form a coalition
        government with the Muslim League in the United Provinces. Instead it
        asked the League leaders to dissolve their parliamentary party in the
        Provincial Assembly and join the Congress. Another important Congress
        move after the 1937 elections was its Muslim mass contact movement to
        persuade the Muslims to join the Congress and not the Muslim League. One
        of its leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru, even declared that there were only two
        forces in India, the British and the Congress. All this did not go
        unchallenged. Quaid-i-Azam countered that there was a third force in
        South Asia constituting the Muslims. The All-India Muslim League, under
        his gifted leadership, gradually and skillfully started to consolidate
        the Muslims on one platform. It did not miss to exploit even small
        Congress mistakes in its favor.
    </p>

    <p>The 1930s saw realization among the Muslims of their separate identity
        and their anxiety to preserve it within separate territorial boundaries.
        An important element that brought this simmering Muslim nationalism in
        the open was the charter of the Congress rule in the Muslim minority
        provinces during 1937-39. The Congress policies in these provinces hurt
        Muslim susceptibilities. These were calculated aims to obliterate the
        Muslims as a separate cultural unity. The Muslims now abandoned to think
        in terms of seeking safegaurds and began to consider seriously the
        demand for a separate Muslim state. During 1937-1939, several Muslim
        leaders and thinkers inspired by Allama Iqbal's ideas, presented
        elaborate schemes of partitioning the sub-continent on communal lines.
        The All-India Muslim League on March 23, 1940, in a resolution at its
        Lahore session, demanded separate homeland for the Muslims in the Muslim
        majority regions of the subcontinent. The resolution was commonly
        referred to as the Pakistan Resolution.
    </p>

    <p>The British Government recognized the genuineness of the Pakistan demand
        indirectly in the proposals for the transfer of power which, Sir
        Stafford Cripps brought to India in 1942. Both the Congress and the
        All-India Muslim League rejected these proposals for different reasons.
        The principle of secession of Muslim India as a separate dominion was,
        however, conceded in these proposals. After the failure, a prominent
        Congress leader, C. Rajagopalachari, suggested a formula for a separate
        Muslim state in the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress,
        which was rejected at the time but later on, in 1944, formed the basis
        of the Gandhi-Jinnah talks.
    </p>

    <p>The Pakistan demand was popularized during the Second World War. Every
        section of the Muslim community - women, students, Ulema and businessmen
        - was organized under the banner of the All-India Muslim League.
        Branches of the party were opened in the remote corners on the
        subcontinent. Literature in the form of pamphlets, books, magazines and
        newspapers was produced to explain the Pakistan demand and distributed
        largely.
    </p>

    <p>The support gained by the All-India Muslim League and its demand for
        Pakistan was tested after the failure of the Simla Conference 1945.
        Elections were called to determine the respective strength of the
        political parties. The Muslim League swept all the thirty seats in the
        central legislature and in the provincial elections also its victory was
        outstanding. After the elections, on April 8-9, 1946, the All-India
        Muslim League called a convention of the newly elected League members in
        the central and provincial legislatures at Dehli. This convention which
        constituted virtually a representative assembly of the Muslims of South
        Asia, on a motion by the Chief Minister of Bengal, Hussein Shaheed
        Suhrawardy, reiterated the Pakistan demand in clearer terms.
    </p>
    <p>In early 1946, the British Government sent a Cabinet Mission to the
        subcontinent to resolve the constitutional deadlock. The Mission
        conducted negotiations with various political parties but failed to
        evolve an agreed formula. Finally, Cabinet Mission announced its own
        plan which, among other provisions, envisaged three federal groupings,
        two of them comprising the Muslim majority provinces, linked at the
        Center in a loose federation with three subjects. The Muslim League
        accepted the Plan, as a strategic move, expecting to achieve its
        objective in a not-too-distant future. The Congress also agreed to the
        Plan but soon realizing its implications to the Congress, its leaders
        began to interpret in a way not visualized by the authors of the Plan.
        This provided the All-India Muslim League an excuse to withdraw its
        acceptance of the Plan and the party observed August 16 as a 'Direct
        Action Day' to show Muslim solidarity in support of the Pakistan demand.
    </p>

    <p>In October 1946, an Interim Government was formed. The Muslim League sent
        its representatives under the leadership of its General Secretary, Mr.
        Liaquat Ali Khan, with the aim to fight for the party objective from
        within the Interim Government. After a short time the situation inside
        the Interim Government and outside convinced the Congress leadership to
        accept Pakistan as the only solution of the communal problem. The
        British Government, after a last attempt to save the Cabinet Mission
        Plan in December 1946, also moved toward a plan for the partition of
        India. The last British Viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten, came with a
        clear mandate to draft a plan for the transfer of power. After holding
        talks with political leaders and parties, he prepared a Partition Plan
        for the transfer of power which, after its approval by the British
        Government, was announced on June 3, 1947. Both the Congress and the
        Muslim League accepted the plan. Two largest Muslim Majority provinces,
        Bengal and Punjab was partitioned. The assemblies of west Punjab, East
        Bengal, and Sind; and in Baluchistan, the Quetta Municipality and the
        Shahi Jirga voted for Pakistan. Referenda were held in the North-West
        Frontier Province and the District of Sylhet in Assam which resulted in
        an overwhelming vote for Pakistan. On August 14, 1947, the new state of
        Pakistan came into existence.
