    <p>You fish because you love the great outdoors, and
        wherever you find outstanding fishing, you also tend to find Mother
        Nature at her loveliest. Trout demand the cold, clear, clean water, and
        thrive in mountains, meadows, valleys, and forests.

        Trout fish of northern mountain streams is one of the best in taste throughout
        the world. Kaghan, Swat, Ghizer, and Baltistan are the best places for
        trout fishing. Streams and lakes of Gilgit are full of trout fish. One
        may find them at the Kargah Nullah (10 kms. from Gilgit), Singal (56
        kms), Gakuch (73 kms), and Phandar (117 kms from Gilgit).

    </p>
    <p>Fishing is the chief sport in Kaghan. Brown Trout and
        Mahasheer are stocked in pure silvery waters between Kaghan and Naran.
        The Kunhar river trout is considered to be the best throughout the
        sub-continent. Lake Saif-ul-Muluk, located near Kaghan valley, offers a
        scenic spot for fishing.
