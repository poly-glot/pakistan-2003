        <p>The wild and roaring streams and rivers of the Northern Pakistan
            possess great potential for white and wild water sports. The rapids
            of these streams and rivers provide the ultimate adventure and
            thrill in mountain water sports and lend themselves to canoeing,
            Kayaking and white water rafting.

            The rivers of Pakistan are spread like a net through its length &amp; breadth. Right from the heights
            of Karakorams. The Himalayas and the Hindukash, Pakistani revers
            change courses and flows until they all meet the mighty Indus, at
            different points which ulitmately falls into the Arabian Sea. These
            rivers are ideal for all kinds of water sports like rafting,
            canoeing, boating, &amp; sailing.
