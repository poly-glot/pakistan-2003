        <p>Pakistanis truly take pride in their 5,000 years old history which
            goes back even further into the hoary past yet untraced.
        </p>
        <p>In the words of Sir Mortimer Wheeler, famed British Archaeologist,
            Pakistan enjoys a high international position in the history of past
            achievements by virtue of possessing the greatest vestiges of one of
            the first three mature civilizations of the world.

            heritage of Pakistan one may visit The National Ethnographic Museum,
            Lok Mela Folk Art and Craft Fair, Shah Faisal Mosque, one of Asia's
            largest most impressive. While in Peshawar, a few kilometers from
            the Khyber Pass, one may find a mix of Pakhtun, Afghan, and Chitral
            people to name a few. The Old City has a special bazaar for every
            kind of handmade crafts, brass, leather, jewellery, many from tribal
            areas of the Northwest Frontier Province. Excellent ethnographic
            museum and collection of Gandhara art. Possible to see Khattak dance
            performance. One of the major attractions of Chitral, is the famous
            Kalash valley - the home of the Kafir-Kalash or "Wearers of the
            Black Robes", a primitive pagan tribe. Their ancestry is enveloped
            in mystery and is the subject of controversy. A legend says that
            five soldiers of the legions of Alexander of Macedonia settled in
            Chitral and are the progenitors of the Kafir-Kalash.

            <img src="/img/activities/history_and_culture/activities_history_and_culture_02t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">A few miles from Rawalpindi is
            Takht-e-Bai, which hosts numerous Buddhist shrines dating from the
            1st to 7th B.C. While in Lahore one may drive south into Punjab,
            where there is the famous Rohtas Fort, a magnificent example of
            military architecture, the construction of which started in the mid
            - 16th Century. The old City of Lahore has artisan workshops and the
            Famed Shalimar Gardens. The Sunehri Masjid (Golden Mosque) is called
            so because of its three golden domes and dazzling gold plated
            minarets. Here also is the museum dedicated to Mohammed Abdur Rahman
            Chughtai, master artist and "reinventor" of Mughal and Persian
            painting traditions. One may also pay a visit to the Lahore Fort,
            which is a palace of immense proportions. The Royal Quarters have
            brilliant examples of design and handicraft techniques, no longer
            practiced.

        </p>
        <p>By heading southwest towards the Mid Indus River one may reach the
            culturally rich city of Multan. This town has a most distinctive
            structure - the shrine of Shah Rukn-iAlam. The Hussein Agahi Bazaar
            also has crafts traditional to this area. Across the River and south
            of Dera Ghazi Khan, is Choti the home of the chief of the Leghari
            Baluch tribe. This remarkable residence is a prime example of Mughal
            architecture and interior design. East of Multan is the area of
            Cholistan, where you may be able to meet some of nomadic people and
            get a glimpse of their unique dress, learn about their crafts and
            perhaps see the "Camel dance".

            <img src="/img/activities/history_and_culture/activities_history_and_culture_03t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">The Bahawalpur area is famous for
            its varied handicrafts. The ethnographic museum has a remarkable
            collection of textiles, embroideries, jewellery and costumes from

            construction built on several levels, and Methelo, the abode of
            Sindhi master of embroidery. Embroidery on leather can be found in
            Shikarpur and Khairpur regions. You can visit the town of Thatta,
            located near Karachi. It holds a site of a brick mosque with 93
            domes which is another remarkable example of Mughal architecture.
            This is an area of magnificent handicrafts, among them textiles with
            block printing and bandhani are of great admiration. The Makli Hill
            area has hundreds of tombs, with a unique construction and ornate
            inscribed stonework.
        </p>
        <p>Pakistan is a great reservoir of the heritage of the Indus, &amp;
            Gandhara Civilizations. With layers of various Gandhara Kingdoms, it
            is unsurpassed as a treasure house of the Greco-Buddhist sculptures
            &amp; artifacts. Moghul monuments are strewn all over the country.
