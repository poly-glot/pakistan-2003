    <p><img src="/img/activities/festivals_basant_01t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">With
        the advent of spring, skies of Lahore and Rawalpindi are resplendent
        with all types and sizes of kites. The entire population participates in
        kite flying matches to herald the coming of spring. That is why this
        festival is also known as "Jashn-e-Baharan". This festival is at its
        peak in the spirited city of Lahore. Lahorites enthusiastically
        participate various fun activities while kite flying being the main
        attraction. Basant is not only a kite flying event, but also a cultural
        festival of traditional food, dresses, dances and music.
