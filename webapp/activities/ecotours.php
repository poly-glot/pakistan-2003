        Eco-tours developed to witness the Marine
        Turtles and Mangrove Forests provide an instilling experience to all
        nature enthusiasts. A drive to the beaches of Hawks Bay and Sandspit
        (near Karachi) is one of the greatest sources of pleasure to a nature
        lover. This unique tour will take you to the shores of the Karachi coast
        where 'Green Turtle' and 'Olive Ridley' are found during the nesting
        seasons on the beaches of Hawks Bay and Sandspit. During autumn, after
        the monsoons when the sea is calmer tourists may sit quietly on the
        beach on a moonlit might and watch to see the turtles come up and lay
        their eggs and leave them in the enclosing warmth of the soft sand for
        the heat of the sun to incubate till young hatchlings emerge and
        scramble to the sea. One may also take a tour to Somiani Bay Mangrove
        Forest that is the breeding ground for fish and shrimps and home to many
        resident and migratory birds.

    <p>On the whole these experiences may develop a sense of respect and love of
        nature blended with exotic scenes from the epic mother nature movie.
