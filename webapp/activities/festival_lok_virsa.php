        largest cultural activity in Pakistan is the annual National Folk
        Festival (Lok Mela), held in October each year. Over the past two
        decades, this festival has taken on an international flavour and more
        than 20 different countries have sent their artisans and performers to
        participate in the festival. Nationally, the festival has become a thing
        of pride for artisans and performers, who come on their own to
        participate. Most important of all, the Provinces of Pakistan and Azad
        Jammu &amp; Kashmir put up beautifully decorated pavilions and visitors
        have the unique opportunity to see an assortment of Pakistan's
        traditionally rich culture in the federal capital of Islamabad for an
        exciting ten days.

    <p>An exhibition of artisans at work under the banner of the
        Heritage Museum forms the core of this festival. The Research &amp;
        Media Centre of Lok Virsa arranges groups of dancers that perform all
        over the festival grounds, inviting visitors to join in, and in the
        evening, arranges music concerts from all parts of Pakistan.
        Documentation of the festival is carried out by Lok Virsa's researchers,
        who interview all the artisans and artists.
