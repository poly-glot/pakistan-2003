        <p>There are plenty of opportunities for cross country mountain
            bicycling in all the mountain ranges of the country. However, due to
            higher temperatures in the mountains except for the Northern
            Pakistan, this sport can only be undertaken during the winters. The
            smooth lower hills of Swat, Azad Kashmir, and Galliyat provide
            adequate opportunities for mountain bikers.
