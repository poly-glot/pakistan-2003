            Karachi is indeed a shopping heaven. Sadder is the central shopping area in Karachi, it is spread around
            and between the two main streets. Abdullah Haroon road and
            Zaib-un-Nisa Street, and is about 1 km from south to north. It is
            fun to spend a few hours wandering through alleyways, where
            Victorian brick archietecture rub shoulders with modern concrete..
            it is all very lively and noisy with a great variety of shops in a
            succession of different bazaar's each specializing in its own
            commodity. Going north upto Abdullah Haroon road, you first come to
            Zainab Market on the right. Inside we find dozen's of shop's,
            selling new copper's, Brass onyx, inlaid woodwork, lacquer work,
            hand block printed cloth's and applique bedspreads. Some shops sell
            excellent old emroided Sindhi cloth. Traditional wedding dresses

            Bhori bazaar is down the side lanes to the north of the carpet

        <p>While in Lahore the Anarkali Bazaar is the most fascinating. The
            alleys and lanes of this bazaar are full of exciting wares,
            especially traditional crafts like leatherwear, embroided garments,
            glass bangles, beaten gold and silver jewelry, creation in silk-
            anything that you wish to bargain. It is named after the Akbar's
            Courtesan called Anarkali, Who, according to legend was put to death
            by Emperor Akbar for having a love affair with prince Salim, Later
            known as Jehangir. Old brass and copper are another good buy from
            the shops around the Charing Cross.

            Some good buys can be found in the brass bazaar in the old city but it is difficult to find and is
            usually unpolished or still coated in tin. Brass is poisonous and
            cannot be used for food until tinned. Other Shopping areas in Lahore
            may include the Sarafa Bazaar, Copper and Brass Bazaar, Kashmiri
            Bazaar, Liberty Market etc.

        <p>While in the city Multan, the Mangoes of Shujabad district are the
            best in the world. Apart from this, Multani khussa (shoes);
