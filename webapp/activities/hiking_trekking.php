        <p>Stretching North from the Arabian Sea, the plains of Pakistan
            culminate in the lush valleys of Dir , Swat and Kaghan. Beyond lie
            the great Northern valleys of Chitral, Gilgit, Hunza and Baltistan.
            Hunza is an ideal for mountaineering, trekking and hiking.
            <img src="/img/activities/hiking_trekking/activities_hiking_01t.jpg" class="thumb" align="left">Most parts of Hunza offer an
            awe-inspiring view of Rakaposhi (7,788 metres). The snows of
            Rakaposhi glitter in the moonlight, producing an atmosphere of
            ethereal magnetism. Further North, lies the Karakorum and Hindukush
            ranges shaping the western extension of the Himalayas.

        </p>
        <p>The land in these Northern valleys is best described as a mountainous
            desert. During winter, heavy snow separate the valleys from winter,
            heavy snow separate the valleys from the rest of the world of six
            months. In the summer, temperatures over 100 degrees are common. In
            Skardu, one is immediately struck by the juxta - position of sand
            dunes and snow-capped peaks. All these beautiful valleys mentioned
            above make Pakistan really trekker's paradise.

            One of the most popular trek is the
            Baltoro trek which ends up at Concordia. Concordia is the point
            where all the Glaciers coming from K-2, Broad-peak, and
            Gasherbrum-IV meet and flow down towards Paiju peak, like a highway.
            Nowhere in the world one can witness four 8000 meter peaks in such a
            small radius. They are K-2, Broad peak, Gasherbrum-I and
            Gasherbrum-II. On this trek, besides these 8000 meter giants one can
            enjoy the scenarios of Masherbrum, Muztagh towers, Chogolisa,
            Baltoro Cathedrals and numerous other peaks. Amongst the other
            popular treks there are Biafo-Hisper trek, Nanga Parbat trek,
            Rakaposhi trek, Trichmir trek, and countless other trekking routes.
            There are still certain areas in Pakistan yet to be explored and
            this virgin land is waiting to be explored.
